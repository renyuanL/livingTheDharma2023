1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,800
Today we are going to talk about Unconditioned Dharmas.

2
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,600
It is the state of Nirvana that we would like to reach.

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,200
How do we find this Unconditioned State?

4
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,400
It is actually within all the Conditioned Dharma,

5
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:33,200
which are all the rising and ceasing of all the phenomena due to cause and effect.

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:40,200
So we want to live in this world of Conditioned Existence while seeing the Unconditional,

7
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,800
that is called being in the world while transcending the world,

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,400
to be able to reach the state of enlightenment.

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,800
That's our goal.

10
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,000
Today we are going to look at the One Hundred Dharma Shastra

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,600
by Vasubandhu Bodhisattva that talks about the six states of Unconditioned Dharma.

12
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,600
Number one is Unconditioned Empty Space.

13
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:14,400
We use Empty Space as the overview of the Unconditioned State.

14
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,200
Our mind should be like the empty sky that is free from any changes,

15
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,800
that doesn't have rising or ceasing.

16
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,800
So it's not the dharma of form,

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,400
it's not the body and it's not the dharma of the mind.

18
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,200
It's away from the body and the mind.

19
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:40,600
It's not changing and it's permanent and free without any delusional discrimination.

20
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,800
It should be empty of the self, empty of others,

21
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:50,900
empty of living beings, empty of life span according to the Diamond Sutra.

22
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:55,600
We use the sky to describe the state of emptiness.

23
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:02,800
Once Master Xuyin offered the assembly tea and peanuts on New Year's Eve.

24
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,600
After the assembly has tasted the peanuts, he asked,

25
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,800
Does the peanuts taste anything to you?

26
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,400
Then he said, If the peanuts have flavor to you,

27
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,700
that's the delusional discrimination of ordinary beings.

28
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:24,600
If it doesn't taste anything to you, then you're no different than a rock or wood.

29
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,300
This is the non-dual negation in Buddhism.

30
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,600
If you think the peanut tastes good,

31
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,600
that is living in the world of conditioned dharma.

32
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,900
If the peanut doesn't taste like anything to you,

33
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,200
you're attached to the unconditioned dharma.

34
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,000
So you don't want to be attached to the conditioned or the unconditioned,

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,800
because either way would be attachment.

36
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,400
The key is to sever all our dualism and our attachment to the idea

37
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,900
of right or wrong, good or evil, beauty and ugliness.

38
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:04,900
We want to sever all attachment to dualism and to the idea of the self.

39
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:10,600
Number two, unconditioned extinction attained by selection.

40
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:16,700
This is reaching Nirvana and here it's called extinction by selection,

41
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,600
which means choosing or wisdom.

42
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,200
So we want to reach Nirvana through prajna.

43
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,900
There are two kinds of obstacles that we have to overcome to reach the state of Nirvana.

44
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,400
One is the obstacle of affliction.

45
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,000
Two is the obstacle of the known.

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,900
These two things block us from reaching enlightenment.

47
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,200
So it's actually our obstacles.

48
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,900
This obstacle of affliction is because of our attachment to self.

49
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:53,100
Because we have the idea of the self, thinking this body is me, everything is mine,

50
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:58,000
that's why we have affliction of greed, anger and ignorance.

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,300
So we need to overcome this obstacle to reach this extinction or unconditioned state.

52
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,800
The obstacle of known is because of our attachment to dharmas,

53
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,100
which is all phenomenon.

54
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,600
We think all the phenomenon are real.

55
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:19,800
That's why we are stuck in this world of conditioned arising.

56
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,600
Let go of our attachment to the self,

57
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,600
and let go of our attachment to the dharma.

58
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,500
We call it emptiness of self and emptiness of dharmas.

59
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,600
That's how we reach the state of extinction.

60
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,900
So this is through prajna.

61
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,800
We call it selection here.

62
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,200
Number three is unconditioned extinction that is unselected.

63
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,800
So opposite of number two, this is due to prajna.

64
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,200
We reach the state of unconditioned extinction.

65
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,400
Number three is unselected.

66
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,400
Due to our concentration, our deep meditation,

67
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,400
not because of our choosing, our wisdom.

68
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,400
There are two kinds of unconditioned extinction that is unselected.

69
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:12,400
One is the absence of conditioning factors that is due to our deep concentration.

70
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:19,400
When we have deep samadhi, we can reach this level of stillness that is like nirvana.

71
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,400
Two is fundamental purification.

72
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:27,400
Of the self nature, we innately are supposed to be in nirvana.

73
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,400
That is aligned with our own nature.

74
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,400
We are supposed to be in the state of unconditioned nirvana.

75
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,400
Four is unconditioned unmoving extinction.

76
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,400
This is just like the absence of conditional factors.

77
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,400
In deep concentration, we are absent of any conditioned factors.

78
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,400
Our mind is not moving.

79
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:57,400
And still, there is no more conditioned factors that make us be in the conditioned state.

80
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,400
There are three kinds of worlds.

81
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
The world of desire.

82
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,400
Number two is the world of form.

83
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,400
And number three is the formless world.

84
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:13,400
We are right now in the world of desire because we are full of greed and lust.

85
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,400
There are actually heavenly beings that are in the world of form.

86
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,400
Which means they don't have the intense desire like us.

87
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:26,400
They are always in deep meditation and they still have a physical body.

88
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
And number three, the formless world.

89
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:35,400
The heavenly beings with deeper meditation, they do not have body and form anymore.

90
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:43,400
Unconditioned, unmoving extinction is talking about the heavenly beings in the world of form.

91
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,400
Which are in jhana, of deep concentration.

92
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:53,400
First level jhana, second level jhana, third level and the fourth jhana.

93
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,400
This is actually talking about fourth jhana.

94
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,400
Very deep concentration.

95
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,400
But this can be ordinary beings just like a heavenly beings with deep concentration.

96
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,400
Without intense greed or lust.

97
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,400
But they are not really enlightened.

98
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,400
They still have the idea of the self and they still have afflictions.

99
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,400
Number five is unconditioned extinction.

100
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,400
Extinction of feelings and thinking.

101
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,400
This is actually the heavenly beings in the formless world.

102
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,400
They don't have the physical body anymore.

103
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,400
It's just the mind but it's free from feeling and thinking.

104
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:38,400
Such as the arhats, they really don't have the idea of the self anymore.

105
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,400
Their sixth consciousness actually stops.

106
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,400
They no longer have the feelings and the thinking like all of us.

107
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,400
The feeling of pleasure and pain do not even register for them.

108
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,400
They don't have to have patience to endure the pain because they don't even feel the pain.

109
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,400
That's the things that reach this level of nirvana.

110
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,400
Sixth is unconditioned true suchness.

111
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,400
This is our goal.

112
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:14,400
To be back to our true suchness free from the self and empty of all dharmas.

113
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,400
This is our true state.

114
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,400
All our cultivation are to reach this level.

115
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,400
Get rid of attachment to the self and attachment to all dharmas.

116
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:30,400
In the consciousness school of Buddhism, we talk about three natures.

117
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,400
One, the fully conceptualized nature.

118
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,400
Two, other dependent nature.

119
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,400
Three, the fully accomplished nature.

120
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,400
Amidst of all the other dependent nature,

121
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,400
which means all the phenomenon,

122
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,400
all the condition arising,

123
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:52,400
our life that we're experiencing due to the wholesome and unwholesome karmic seeds in our laya consciousness,

124
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,400
that's why everything manifests in our world right now.

125
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:01,400
If we do not give rise to false thinking and delusional discrimination,

126
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,400
which is the fully conceptualized nature,

127
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,400
then we will reach the fully accomplished nature,

128
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,400
which is our true suchness.

129
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,400
Do not give in to our fully conceptualized nature.

130
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:20,400
Which is our delusional discrimination due to our ego that we think this way.

131
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,400
A saint do not give rise to the delusional discrimination.

132
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,400
They basically stay in the state of Nirvana

133
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,400
and do not give rise to those thinking of dualism.

134
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,400
The master Kumara Java,

135
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:38,400
he translated a lot of sutras such as Amitabha Sutra.

136
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,400
When he was only seven years old,

137
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,400
he went to the temple

138
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,400
with his mom.

139
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,400
He went into the main hall.

140
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,400
He saw the big bull bell,

141
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:54,400
which is the musical instrument that we use for all the Buddhist ceremonies.

142
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,400
This instrument is very heavy, very big.

143
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,400
It's made out of bronze in the shape of a bull.

144
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,400
So he picked it up and started playing with it.

145
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,400
After he played for a while,

146
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,400
then he thought to himself,

147
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,400
wait a minute, I'm only seven.

148
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,400
How can I hold up this bull bell?

149
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
That's impossible.

150
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,400
Just that one thought,

151
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,400
he couldn't hold it anymore.

152
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,400
He dropped it on the floor and it made a big noise.

153
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,400
That's when he became enlightened.

154
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,400
What did he realize?

155
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,400
He realized everything is just a mind.

156
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:35,400
Just one thought thinking he's incapable of holding this bull bell.

157
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,400
He couldn't hold it anymore.

158
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,400
Everything is just consciousness only.

159
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,400
When he gave rise to the thought,

160
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,400
that is the fully conceptualized nature.

161
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:50,400
The big bull bell is the other dependent nature.

162
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,400
If he does not give rise to conceptualized nature,

163
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,400
then it's already the fully accomplished nature.

164
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,400
So all we have to do in all the conditioned nature,

165
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,400
Dharma,

166
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:08,400
we do not give rise to our delusional discrimination.

167
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,400
Then it's already

168
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,400
the fully enlightened state,

169
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,400
the nirvana that we're reaching for.

170
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,400
So where do you find this unconditioned state?

171
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,400
It's within all the conditioned state right now.

172
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,400
We call it being in the world while transcending the world.

173
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,400
Everything is okay.

174
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,400
Everything is perfect.

175
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,400
Then life is perfect.

176
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,400
So that's the class for today.

177
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,400
Thank you for listening.

178
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,400
Amitabha.
