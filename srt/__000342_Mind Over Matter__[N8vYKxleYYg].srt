00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,040
Today we are going to talk about mind over matter.

2
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:22,360
Our mind creates the physical world, we call it matter.

3
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:26,400
If we can change our mind, then we can change the physical world.

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,800
According to the consciousness-only school of Buddhism, it says we have eight consciousnesses.

5
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,440
We have the eyes consciousness, ears, nose, tongue, and body.

6
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,080
These five come into direct contact with the outside world.

7
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:48,680
These five have minimal ability to perceive the outside world.

8
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:53,440
They have to work with the sixth consciousness, the mind consciousness,

9
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,360
in order to have cognitive function.

10
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:03,520
Unfortunately, this mind consciousness is controlled by the seventh consciousness,

11
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,400
the manas consciousness, which is full of the self, the ego.

12
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:16,400
The manas consciousness is infatuated with the alaya consciousness, thinking that is the self.

13
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,400
This is how we experience the world.

14
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,720
Unfortunately, this is a deluded mind.

15
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,320
If we can transform our consciousness into wisdom,

16
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,440
then it's the true Buddha nature, our true suchness.

17
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:39,120
But little do we know that this alaya consciousness is the same as our true Buddha nature.

18
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,440
It's one of the same thing.

19
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,240
It's just one is deluded, one is enlightened.

20
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,840
It's just in different states, but it's the same mind.

21
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,680
Therefore, we need to understand how to transform the deluded state right now.

22
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,680
First, we have to realize that the mind is the same as the alaya consciousness.

23
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,280
Therefore, we need to understand how to transform the deluded state right now.

24
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,760
Second, we have to realize that all the consciousnesses are ignorant.

25
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,040
They're deluded.

26
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,160
The alaya consciousness is called the basic ignorance.

27
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:12,520
It's the big warehouse that carries us through all our lives of reincarnation.

28
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,520
You can call it the soul.

29
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,120
That's our big root, ignorance.

30
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,240
It's the opposite of the secondary ignorance, the sixth consciousness.

31
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,640
This thinking mind is only secondary

32
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,920
because it's easier to see, easier to change the mind consciousness.

33
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:38,280
But it's harder to realize the existence of the profound and subtle alaya consciousness.

34
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,680
That's why this is basic and this is secondary.

35
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,960
This is like brooding the tree from its root.

36
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,880
This is like breaking up the branches of the tree.

37
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:55,520
What we need to do is completely wake up from the dream, the whole life that

38
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:02,980
we're having is a big illusion. To know illusion is to depart from it. To depart from it is

39
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:08,580
to be enlightened. If we just wake up and know that this is all a dream, then it's the

40
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:16,020
original enlightenment. The modest consciousness is called the unmixed ignorance. This ignorance

41
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:23,960
doesn't have to mix with any other consciousness. It's very distinct and particular. It doesn't

42
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:31,040
need to have other afflictions. It's naturally ignorant. That's why it's called unmixed

43
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:37,600
ignorance. So all of them are ignorant in nature. This alaya consciousness has three

44
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:45,080
names. The first name is store consciousness. It's a big storehouse. Whatever we have done

45
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:52,820
in all our lives is stored in here. What we think every day gets stored in this storehouse

46
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,940
as karmic.

47
00:03:53,960 --> 00:04:00,100
You call it seeds or you call it karmic energies. All your wholesome, unwholesome and neutral

48
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:08,620
deeds are all stored in here. When the condition ripens, the seeds develop into a real world.

49
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:17,440
All the matter is created by the alaya consciousness. The seeds, they will manifest into our reality.

50
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:23,940
We do not know that all realities are only images created by our alaya consciousness.

51
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:31,440
Therefore, we think it's real and our mind attached to them. And we're suffering delusions

52
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:40,120
and afflictions because of the outside environment. The second name is called appropriating consciousness.

53
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:48,260
This consciousness appropriates all our sense organs. So our body will not perish as long

54
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:53,800
as we are living. Even when you're sleeping, this consciousness is carrying our body through

55
00:04:53,940 --> 00:05:01,340
so we stay alive. At the moment of our death, it appropriates us into our next life. When

56
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:08,040
parents are consummating, it attaches itself to the egg and the sperm. That's how you develop

57
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:13,700
into a new life. It's all because of this appropriating consciousness.

58
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:22,340
Lastly, it's called the mind. This mind accumulates. You have many, many habits accumulated from

59
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,820
your prior lifetimes.

60
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:30,100
You don't even know. But if you like to meditate this lifetime, it's because you meditated in

61
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:36,180
your prior lifetimes. If you see an insect, you like to kill it, that's because you've

62
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:42,180
done it many, many lifetimes. So you're used to it. We carry many, many habits from our

63
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:49,840
prior lifetimes. That's why it's called the accumulating mind. So the existence of this

64
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,940
alaya consciousness is the basis of Buddhism.

65
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:59,600
That's what reincarnation is. And that is what cause and condition is. If we can understand

66
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:06,280
the existence of alaya, then we know how to change our lives and get out of reincarnation.

67
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:13,280
The alaya is neutral. Whatever you put in it, it carries with it. But the manas, it's

68
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:21,020
naturally defiled because it's full of the self. It naturally has four afflictions all

69
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,020
the time.

70
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,020
Number one is self-view.

71
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:23,920
Number two is self-divine. Number three is self-divine. Number four is self-divine. Number

72
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,940
five is self-divine. Number six is self-divine. Number seven is self-divine.

73
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:30,080
When you're doing wholesome deeds, unwholesome deeds or neutral deeds, it doesn't matter

74
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,720
what you're doing, you always have this idea of the self. When you're doing good deeds,

75
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:42,560
you want people to praise you. You want people to affirm this ego. We always carry this idea

76
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:49,180
of the self. It's always present. We also have the self pride. We think we are special.

77
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,020
We're better than others. Even a dog, even an ant, we think we're better than others.

78
00:06:53,020 --> 00:07:00,340
the ant, even pigs, they are proud of their appearance. Then we have self-love. We're always

79
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:08,280
protecting ourselves, protecting this body, protecting our reputation, our family. We love

80
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:14,720
the self. That's the only thing we really love. And we also have self-ignorance. We're ignorant

81
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:22,600
about the self because we think we have a self. That's the biggest ignorance. These four afflictions

82
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:29,700
are with our manas all the time. That's why it's always defiled. The mind consciousness is the

83
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:35,860
only one that goes outside and experience the world. Because we're attached to the external

84
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:44,280
world, the conditions, we start having afflictions. I listed the six basic afflictions. In favorable

85
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:52,420
conditions, we become greedy. We want it to happen again and again. In unfavorable conditions,

86
00:07:52,600 --> 00:08:00,600
we become angry, bitter. We have resentment, irritation. That's all anger. We also have

87
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:07,740
ignorance. This ignorance is the same as the self-ignorance except the affliction in the

88
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:15,940
seventh manas is inborn. But the mind consciousness ignorance is acquired. It's acquired from

89
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:22,320
your education, your society, your belief system. So the sixth consciousness is more

90
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:29,320
acquired affliction. And we have arrogance. That's the same as self-pride. Except this

91
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:37,420
is inborn, this is acquired. And we have doubts. Deep down inside, we never believe our mind

92
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:43,660
is the Buddha nature. No matter how much we learn about the sutra, we never believe we

93
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:48,980
are the Buddha. If you really believe in it, then you will be enlightened already because

94
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,560
your mind is already the Buddha. But we have doubts.

95
00:08:52,600 --> 00:09:00,520
So that is also a strong affliction. We also have false views. The biggest false view is

96
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:06,360
the view of the self. So it's the same as the self-view. Except this is inborn, this

97
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:13,580
is acquired. So we have all these afflictions in our mind consciousness. When we have these

98
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:21,240
afflictions, these afflictions, it becomes unwholesome deeds and it permeates into seeds

99
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,440
in the laya consciousness.

100
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:22,580
Subtitles by the Amara.org community

101
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:28,820
And then ripens into resolve. And so it's a big reincarnation. So if you want to talk

102
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:34,860
about reincarnation, it all happens in our consciousness. It's a big vicious cycle.

103
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:41,380
The key of learning Buddhism is to change this consciousness. Because that's the only

104
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:47,460
thing we can really change. Our thinking. If we change this, then everything will change.

105
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:52,440
We got to be careful of every one of our thoughts. Because every one of our thoughts

106
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:59,440
is stored in here. We will have karma. Be careful what you think about. It all have

107
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:08,460
consequences. We need to change greed into generosity. Anger into compassion. Ignorance

108
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:17,480
into wisdom. Arrogance into humility. Doubt into faith. False view into right view. Watch

109
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,420
every one of our thoughts and change our afflictions. That's how you purify.

110
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:29,180
Your laya consciousness. Every moment you're thinking, you are changing your laya consciousness.

111
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:36,420
Destiny is in your hand. Right now we have a big earthquake in Turkey. That is our collective

112
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:44,700
deeds, our collective karma in our laya consciousness. We are all responsible for this disaster.

113
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:51,120
Of course, everyone has different level of karmic sea with this event. But we are all

114
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,860
responsible.

115
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:59,120
What we need to do is to repent. Earthquake comes from our pride, our uneven mind. We

116
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:06,660
got to watch our thoughts. That's the only way to improve the world. If we purify our

117
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:13,700
laya consciousness, we will realize the laya consciousness is our true Buddha nature. The

118
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:21,700
suchness. All the ignorance now is the original enlightenment. It's no longer ignorant. We

119
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:29,700
have the pure mind. This mind is actually eternal. It never changes, no matter how many

120
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:36,560
reincarnation we've been through. It's always the same. And it's always permanent. No matter

121
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:43,740
what happens in the outside world, your Buddha nature is permanent. It's the same. And it's

122
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:49,860
immutable, it's not affected by any of your afflictions. None of your afflictions affect

123
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,560
your true nature. And it's natural. Only true Buddha nature. So stay with me and watch next.

124
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:59,320
and it's always pure, it doesn't have the idea of the self, it has no afflictions, and it's self-sufficient.

125
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:06,120
We have perfect wisdom, perfect compassion, and we can be omniscient like Buddha,

126
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,480
if we really go back to our true perfect nature.

127
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:16,680
Ching Yuen Master, he has established more than 300 temples throughout the world.

128
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:22,760
He helped save millions of people to learn Buddhism through his words, through his action.

129
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,440
He was very sick in his old age, but he said,

130
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:33,560
I am not sick, I just have little inconvenience. He worked all his life and never felt tired.

131
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:39,000
That is a Bodhisattva. He has no delusion and no limitation in his mind.

132
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,720
So believe in ourselves and change our destiny for the better. It's really mind over matter.

133
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,600
Thank you for listening.

134
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,680
Amitabha.
