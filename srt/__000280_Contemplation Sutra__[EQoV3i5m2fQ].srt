00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,840
Today we are going to talk about the Contemplation Sutra.

2
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,400
Pure Land Buddhism has three main sutras, the Infinite Life Sutra, the Contemplation

3
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,160
Sutra, and the Amitabha Sutra.

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,880
In this class, we will use verses from the Contemplation Sutra to learn about Mahayana

5
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,880
and Pure Land Buddhism.

6
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,000
Let's first talk about the story behind the Contemplation Sutra.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,600
In Buddha's time, there was a country in India led by King Bimbisara.

8
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,920
Unfortunately, the king's son, Prince Ajatasattu, befriended Devadatta, Buddha's rebellious

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,920
disciple.

10
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,920
Devadatta instigated Prince Ajatasattu to seize the throne and take the throne.

11
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,800
But he refused to do so and was confined to his father.

12
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,100
Queen Bhadigi secretly smuggled food to sustain the imprisoned king.

13
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:08,940
The angry prince found out and almost killed his mother for doing that, but was intervened

14
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,740
by two virtuous ministers.

15
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:17,520
The prince then confined his mother and King Bimbisara starved to death.

16
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,140
Out of extreme pain and sorrow, Queen Bhadigi prayed to Buddha.

17
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,740
Buddha immediately appeared in the palace.

18
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,740
She cried out to Buddha,

19
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:31,160
Buddha, what sin have I committed to have such a wicked son?

20
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:37,100
Please preach to me in detail all the Buddha lands without trouble and sorrow where I can

21
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,100
take rebirth.

22
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:44,500
That's when Buddha showed her all the magnificent Buddha lands, and she chose Amitabha's Western

23
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,780
Pure Land as her final destination for rebirth.

24
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:51,620
That's when Buddha expanded the Sixteen Contemplations to visualize the land of ultimate bliss.

25
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,620
Buddha's words were heard in the palace.

26
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,620
Buddha's words were heard in the palace.

27
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,620
Buddha's words were heard in the palace.

28
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,620
Buddha's words were heard in the palace.

29
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,620
Buddha's words were heard in the palace.

30
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,620
Buddha's words were heard in the palace.

31
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,960
Buddha was using the esoic knowledge to help seal all thenérgy sebened in the appearance

32
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:20,700
of the

33
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,440
Rocky and cover the land of ultimate bliss.

34
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:30,800
When she passed away, she obtained the highest level of the highest grade of lotus flower.

35
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,140
Now let's look at the verses.

36
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:40,380
Because Buddha's Tathagatas have cosmic bodies, and so enter the meditative mind of each sentient

37
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,380
being.

38
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,940
Buddha's body is a cosmic body, which is a Dharmakaya.

39
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,940
It's like the sky that is formless, but it's everywhere.

40
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,500
So where is Buddha?

41
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,680
Buddha is in our mind.

42
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:00,180
In every thought, there is endless number of Buddhas reaching Buddhahood in our mind.

43
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:07,060
When we have one thought of returning to our Dharmakaya at that moment, we are the Buddha.

44
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:12,120
Our original enlightenment is the same as Buddha's final enlightenment.

45
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,380
There is no difference between us and the Buddha.

46
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,820
We are equal and the same.

47
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:23,660
For this reason, when you contemplate a Buddha, that mind takes the form of his Tathagatas.

48
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:30,520
There are 32 physical characteristics and 80 secondary marks of excellence.

49
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:37,440
Because of our Dharmakaya, when we contemplate a Buddha, that includes visualization of the

50
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:44,440
Pure Land or the Buddha, such as explained in the 16 contemplations, include visualizing

51
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:51,900
the water of the Pure Land, the ground, the trees, the palm, and the lotus, or we simply

52
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,540
recite Amitabha Buddha.

53
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,820
Buddha's name that is all included in this contemplation.

54
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:04,200
When we focus on the Buddha, that mind takes on the form of all the great characteristics

55
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,200
of all the Buddhas.

56
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:13,660
Buddha has the 32 physical characteristics such as he has 40 teeth, and he has perfectly

57
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:19,540
round and full shoulders, his hands reach below the knees, and his body is always glowing

58
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,140
in golden light.

59
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,420
And 80 secondary marks are above the Buddha's name.

60
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,420
Buddha's name.

61
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,860
Qa-Chi is above, and Buddha's name is above.

62
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,640
However, he is always on the right side of intelligence, taking control of his making

63
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,640
decisions.

64
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,820
This is an educational faculty subject, and here we understand his advertisements on

65
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,820
the left 42 stages.

66
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,980
And, you can disconnect now, by watching Ahmad Hzal'sdi, and you can see that he is

67
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,660
self-interpreting, and that is his original umbrage based on the communities he out�

68
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,820
of this video, There are manyge hospitalizations, which in

69
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,820
a quarter of the day cannot be treated as a knowledge.

70
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,100
You can click up to see the kind of information I talk about.

71
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,640
He attempted a lot of stunts which are also not expected.

72
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,920
Messiah, or the dwarf Buddha who got all those social connections, but is experienced.

73
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,800
Any kind ofナ, such a character, nail it into the head, almonds on the neck, month

74
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:52,080
Dharma and for all sentient beings. Many kalpas ago, there was a king who pledged a vow to

75
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,760
pursue the Supreme Bodhi. He announced to the world, if there's anyone who can expand

76
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:05,200
the Mahayana Dharma to me, I will be his servant till the end of my life. A sage came forward

77
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:13,300
and said, I have the Mahayana Dharma named the Wondrous Dharmic Lotus Sutra. If you can

78
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:19,760
keep your promise, I will divulge it to you. So the king attended to the sage by picking

79
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:26,540
fruits, drawing water, cooking meals, even used his body as bed for the sage. He did

80
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:33,620
this tirelessly for a thousand years. This king is Shakyamuni Buddha. So all Buddhas

81
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:39,560
have incredible merits and virtues. That's why they have these signs of greatness. When

82
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,280
we contemplate on a Buddha, all these signs are freely available.

83
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:52,400
The Buddha is the same as Buddha. That is the incredible truth of the Pure Land Buddhism.

84
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:59,340
Furthermore, your mind produces the Buddha's image and is itself the Buddha. This is a

85
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:06,860
very firm statement. Whatever your mind produces, you create that world. If our mind produces

86
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:13,280
discontent, mistrust, grudges, and anger, then our mind is in hell.

87
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:21,740
If we produce the Guanyin Bodhisattva's thought of great compassion, then we are Guanyin Bodhisattva.

88
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:29,560
If we produce the Bodhi resolve, such as Amitabha's Forty-Eight Vows, then we are Amitabha. It's

89
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:36,740
all happening in our mind. After his father passed away, Prince Ajatasattva felt great

90
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:43,240
sorrow and repentance. Painful ulcers grew all over his body. The physician told him,

91
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:50,240
Javakka said to him, now only Buddha can cure your mind and your body. The prince went

92
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:57,240
to see Buddha. Buddha was very compassionate toward him and told him, deadly sins are without

93
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:03,480
form. If we confess wholeheartedly, we can wash away all sins. The prince felt great

94
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:10,860
comfort and joy. He brought forth great Bodhi resolve and started chanting the name Amitabha.

95
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,180
He was reborn in the Western Pure Land.

96
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:20,260
With the middle level of the highest grade of lotus flower. So everybody can go to the

97
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:27,460
Western Pure Land because we are Buddha originally. As long as we come back to our Buddha mind,

98
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:30,420
then we can definitely go to the Pure Land.

99
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:37,740
So concentrate your thought on Amitabha, especially invoke his name. When we have even one recitation

100
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:42,240
of his name, it can extinguish 80 kalpas of grave offenses. That's how people can get

101
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,240
rid of their sins.

102
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:51,840
We have to know this Buddha name is our dharmakaya. When we recite this name, our intrinsic Buddha

103
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:59,480
nature will appear. By then, there's no Buddha and no name. You forget what's you or yours.

104
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:04,620
You forget that you're chanting. You're chanting, but you're not really chanting. That's when

105
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:12,920
we reach the Buddha remembrance samadhi. Lastly, the ocean of perfectly and universally enlightened

106
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,180
Buddha.

107
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:20,280
Thus arises in the meditating mind. We call Buddha's wisdom the ocean of perfectly and

108
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,900
universally enlightened Buddhas.

109
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:30,520
Buddha is truly omniscient. He knows the oneness of all things and he sees beyond duality and

110
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:37,400
yet understand how everything properly fit to the great fabric of one's reality. We all

111
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:42,920
have this wisdom innate in us. We just need to bring it out by contemplating, understanding,

112
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,920
and amitabha.

113
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:51,020
When we contemplate on one Buddha, we have contemplated on all Buddhas, and we will see

114
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:57,420
all Buddhas of the ten directions. This is the highest form of the complete and certain

115
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:04,800
Mahayana teaching. It is impossible to rationalize and difficult to conceive. Only those with

116
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:11,760
great wisdom will truly understand and believe in it. In conclusion, wondrous cause and wondrous

117
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,600
effect are not available.

118
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,940
We are not apart from the one mind. The wondrous cause of our pure mind and the wondrous effect

119
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:26,480
of going to the pure land and reaching Buddhahood is all happening in our mind. So we already

120
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:33,200
have everything. Do not seek outside. You already got everything you need. So believe

121
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:40,600
that you are the only son of the wealthy father. You just have to admit it that you have all

122
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,600
the inheritance.

123
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,700
We don't have to be begging for food on the street anymore, which means we don't have

124
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:55,020
to be imprisoned in the painful samsara anymore. We can become a Buddha. With this proper Mahayana

125
00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:02,100
view, recite the Buddha's name wholeheartedly, contemplate on Amitabha, we will definitely

126
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,100
be reborn in the Western Pure Land and reach Buddhahood.

127
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,100
So that's the class for today. Thank you for listening. Amitabha.
