00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,400
Today we are going to talk about Zen. Zen is the Chen school of Buddhism. We will use the

2
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:29,000
Dharma transmission of Patriarch Bodhidharma, the first Patriarch in China of the Chen school

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,280
in the late 5th and early 6th century BC. Zen itself, it means the Buddha mind. Patriarch

4
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:45,240
Bodhidharma says the nature is the mind, the mind is the Buddha, the Buddha is the way,

5
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:52,820
the way is Zen. Our Buddha nature is our pure mind. Our pure mind is the Buddha. You don't

6
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:58,980
have to look for Buddha elsewhere. It's right here, our own mind. And if you find the Buddha

7
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:07,100
then Buddha is the way to enlightenment and the enlightenment is Zen. How do we enter the

8
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:14,500
Zen or enter the way? There are actually two ways. One is entering the way through insight.

9
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:20,860
Two is entering the way through practice. Entering through insight, that's the instantaneous

10
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:27,060
entrance to the way. Entering through practice, that's the gradual entrance to the way. Let's

11
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:33,640
first talk about the instant enlightenment or we call it sudden enlightenment. We want

12
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:41,200
to enter the way or enter the Zen through insight. What is this insight? The insight

13
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:48,660
is to know that our mind, our awareness is the Buddha. How do we know we have this awareness?

14
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:55,180
It's not hard to see we have an aware nature, such as responding, perceiving, arching our

15
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,180
eyebrows, blinking our eyes, moving our eyes. It's not hard to see we have an aware nature,

16
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,020
such as responding, perceiving, arching our eyebrows, blinking our eyes, moving our eyes,

17
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:02,840
moving our hands and feet. That's all our miraculous awareness. So knowing this miraculous

18
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:09,260
awareness is our Buddha nature, then you are the Buddha. Whoever knows his or her nature

19
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:16,500
is the Buddha. But this nature is not apparent because we are strutted by our emotion and

20
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:22,820
our delusion. We are deluded in thinking all experience exists outside of us and we don't

21
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:26,140
know it's all created by our deluded mind. It's all illusory.

22
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:32,780
It's all illusory and it's only a false image. By gaining direct insight into the emptiness

23
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:38,700
of the mind, we will be in this evenness of the mind, knowing that everyone has this Buddha

24
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:45,240
nature. Then we will have no more distinction of the self and the others. We will maintain

25
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:53,700
a stable and clear mind like the wall. Patriarch Bodhidharma is famous for the wall meditation.

26
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,700
Facing a wall in silence is the best way to attain enlightenment. It's the best way to

27
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,700
attain enlightenment. It's the best way to attain enlightenment. It's the best way to attain

28
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,260
enlightenment.itt Music and meditation are pretty much the intermingle. This is the

29
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:07,680
best meditation. This wall symbolizes our mind when it's stable and Unmoved. And full

30
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:14,240
of clarity. All we have to do is to abandon all conceptuality and relax in this utter

31
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:22,040
clarity. We don't have to do anything. Just relax in the natural clarity of our mind.

32
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,700
The Song of enlightenment by Yongjia Zero Master is the best meditation for Mainstream

33
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,700
apartheid.

34
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:33,560
Once we awaken to the Tathagata Zen, the six noble deeds and the 10,000 good actions are

35
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,380
already complete within us.

36
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:43,180
Once we find our true nature, which is called the Tathagata Zen, then all the six paramitas

37
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:47,580
and all the wonderful virtues are already complete and done.

38
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:52,400
So this is the certain enlightenment through our insight.

39
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,400
Step number two is entering the way through practice.

40
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,000
This has four gradual steps.

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,900
One is to accept suffering.

42
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:08,200
We usually react negatively to the adversities of our lives, but we should know that everything

43
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,840
happened to us as the karmic ripening of our past deeds.

44
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,540
So everything happened for a reason.

45
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:22,380
In the Sutra, it says when you face adversity, don't be upset because it makes sense.

46
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,000
Everything makes sense in terms of karma.

47
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
They all happen for a reason.

48
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,380
So do not blame the situation or others.

49
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:35,180
We should take full responsibility of what's happening to us right now.

50
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:41,440
And we should say to ourselves, I accept it with an open heart without complaint of injustice

51
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,500
because there's no injustice in karma.

52
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,820
It's all happening the way it's supposed to be.

53
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,140
We want to spend our energy creating positive conditions.

54
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,760
By doing positive, wholesome deeds.

55
00:04:54,760 --> 00:05:01,940
So be grateful of the situation, be cheerful and thankful, then it's no longer suffering.

56
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:08,580
Suffering usually exists because we do not accept the situation so we see it as suffering.

57
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:13,700
If we can accept it, and then we will have peace of mind, then the suffering will vanish

58
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,700
and dissolve.

59
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,660
When we accept suffering, we have entered the way.

60
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,800
Number two, adapting to conditions.

61
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,060
Number one is talking about pain and sorrow.

62
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:29,080
Number two is talking about pleasure and happiness.

63
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:35,440
If we are blessed by some great reward such as fame or fortune, it is a fruit of a seed

64
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,740
planted by us in the past.

65
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,840
When the condition changes, it will end.

66
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,800
So do not be caught up in our pleasure either.

67
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,420
While the success and failure depend on conditions, the mind neither waxes or wanes.

68
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,420
So do not be caught up in our pleasure either.

69
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,420
While the success and failure depend on conditions, the mind neither waxes or wanes.

70
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,800
So do not be caught up in our pleasure either.

71
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
While the success and failure depend on conditions, the mind neither waxes or wanes.

72
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,800
So do not be caught up in our pleasure either.

73
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,800
While the success and failure depend on conditions, the mind neither waxes or wanes.

74
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
Even though conditions keep changing, but our mind will stay the same.

75
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,180
It doesn't increase or decrease with the outside conditions.

76
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,960
It stays calm and unmoved.

77
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,620
Those who remain unmoved by the wind of joy silently follow the way.

78
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:12,700
That's when we are following the way to enlightenment.

79
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,240
Number three, seeking nothing.

80
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,480
That is the mind of contentment.

81
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,060
We will understand the meaninglessness of all selfishness.

82
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,060
We will understand the meaninglessness of all selfishness.

83
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:30,080
In the Sutra, it says, to seek is to suffer. To seek nothing is bliss. If we can be content

84
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:37,360
and seek nothing, that is true happiness. We even abandon the idea of seeking enlightenment.

85
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:44,000
It says in the Songs of Enlightenment that it cannot be grasped, it cannot be rejected,

86
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,860
just what can be obtained within the unobtainable. That's the reality. There's nothing to gain.

87
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:56,500
We don't gain enlightenment. We cannot grasp enlightenment. We cannot reject enlightenment

88
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:02,180
because it is the state as it is. So there's nothing to do, there's nothing to obtain in

89
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:08,820
the unobtainable. The subject of attaining and the object of attainable, they are both

90
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:16,320
illusory, just concepts from our deluded consciousness. Understand this, then we will no longer seek

91
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,760
for anything. But that doesn't mean we become inactive and

92
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:20,820
blind.

93
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:48,260
4. To unite with the way. Finally, we are like the instant enlightenment with the insight,

94
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,760
knowing the emptiness of the self and all that is within us.

95
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:58,760
This is also called practicing the dharma. Dharma is the truth that all natures are pure.

96
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:05,300
By this truth, all appearances are empty. Now we truly understand the emptiness of all

97
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:13,400
nature. Defilement and attachment, subject and object do not exist. All is illusory,

98
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:20,660
just like the moon that's reflected in the water. It's only a false image. That is the

99
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:29,060
reality. It says in the sutra, Dharma includes no beings because it is free from the impurity

100
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:36,900
of beings. Dharma includes no self because it is free from the impurity of self. Dharma

101
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:43,280
is emptiness. It has no living beings. When you have a concept of living beings, that

102
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:50,560
is still impurity. It is no longer emptiness, and doesn't include the concept of a self. When you

103
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:59,200
have the self is still impurity all things are pure in nature because they're all emptiness so

104
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:07,200
that is true insight when we have the insight of emptiness that's when we can give our body life

105
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:16,320
and property in charity without regret without the vanity of the giver the gift or recipient

106
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:23,200
without bias or attachment that's when we have unconditional giving like a true bodhisattva

107
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:31,280
at the end we will finally realize the mind is the buddha the buddha is the mind beyond the mind

108
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:41,040
there's no buddha beyond the buddha there is no mind our pure mind is the buddha is zen and is

109
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,000
the way in this lifetime use all situations to practice

110
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:53,920
the dharma to find the way by accepting suffering adapting to condition seeking

111
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:00,640
nothing and to unite with the way we will realize the mind that's chanting amitabha

112
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:07,840
is the buddha so that's the class for today thank you for listening amitabha
