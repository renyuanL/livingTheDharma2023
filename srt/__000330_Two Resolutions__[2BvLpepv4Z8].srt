1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,080
Today we are going to talk about Two Resolutions.

2
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,400
How come we can never change what we want to do with our lives?

3
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,800
We cannot put it into fruition.

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,920
We are going to talk about the Shakyamuni Sutra, Two Resolutions.

5
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,440
Hopefully we will find out the problem of our cultivation and our lives.

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:42,080
The first resolution, you must carefully consider whether the resolve on the cause ground and

7
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,920
the enlightenment on the ground of fruition are the same or different.

8
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,920
We want to reach Buddhahood, that's the ground of fruition that we want.

9
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,360
But what is your cause?

10
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,120
You must have the right cause in order to have the right result.

11
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,740
So what is the cause?

12
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,800
We don't have the right cause to begin with.

13
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,600
We are all stuck with our five aggregates.

14
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,920
We are using the deluded mind, that's why we cannot reach enlightenment.

15
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,260
Right now we are using these five aggregates thinking that's me.

16
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,200
That's why we are creating the world of five turbidities.

17
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,900
We have the turbidity of time because we are all stuck with our form.

18
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,460
We are very selfish.

19
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:32,960
We are all attached to the body, that's why the world is so corrupted.

20
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,700
Then we have the turbidity of views.

21
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,960
We only care about our own feelings, our own happiness.

22
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:46,200
Everybody is chasing after their own self-benefit, that's why the views are corrupted.

23
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,600
We have the turbidity of afflictions.

24
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,760
We are all caught up in ourselves.

25
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:55,080
We are all caught up in our own thinking, thinking about the past, future, present,

26
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,000
all based on the self.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,140
And all living beings are corrupted because we have the mental formation of the strong

28
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,540
self.

29
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,360
Everybody has deep attachment to the ego.

30
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:14,120
Lastly, our lifespan is very corrupted, short and whimsical because we are attached to our

31
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,620
consciousness, it's the deluded self.

32
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,560
We are using the five aggregates.

33
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,560
So what is your cause?

34
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,880
The cause is the real me, but that should not be your cause ground because this is all

35
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,460
based on cause and condition.

36
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:35,480
We must decisively renounce this pseudo-self, condition, appearance.

37
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,700
This is not the real me.

38
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:45,100
If you rely on this view to cultivate, you will not succeed no matter how hard you chant

39
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,340
the Buddha's name, how hard you meditate.

40
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,340
You will not reach Buddhahood.

41
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,340
You will not reach Buddhahood.

42
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,340
You will not reach Buddhahood.

43
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,620
For example, why are you listening to the Dharma or why are you a Buddhist?

44
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:01,320
You don't even know why we are still using the selfish self to cultivate.

45
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,520
We will never reach the right fruition.

46
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,060
So let go of this attachment to the self.

47
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,320
First, carefully consider.

48
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,320
That means recognize.

49
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,360
If you start off the wrong foot, you will not reach the right destination.

50
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,360
Clarify.

51
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,560
It's like we are trying to purify muddy water.

52
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,560
It's like we are trying to purify muddy water.

53
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,560
It's like we are trying to purify muddy water.

54
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,300
Put it in a clean vessel that is still and unmoved.

55
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:31,400
All of the sand and slits will settle to the bottom, then you will have clean water.

56
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:39,460
So, that's why we can clean this turbulent, dirty water by residing in our perfect, tranquil

57
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,360
nature that does not rise or cease.

58
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,900
There is neither production nor extinction.

59
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,880
Then we will completely accomplish the cultivation of, and you will experience rescuing, reappointment.

60
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,560
No matter how cuz, it's a better explanation.

61
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:58,000
off and the certification to the ground of fruition so if you really want to reach buddhahood

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:06,880
you have to start with the buddha mind that does not go with your selfish self that is the first

63
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:17,760
resolution you must tell yourself no more selfish pseudo self the five aggregates decisively

64
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:24,960
renounce it when you're not attached to this selfish eye anymore that's when you can start

65
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:34,240
cultivating figure this out in the first place the first patriarch of zen buddhism is bodhidharma

66
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:43,120
the second patriarch is huike when huike first met bodhidharma he was in the cave meditating

67
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,680
facing the wall and ignoring him so huike stayed outside

68
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:54,800
in the snow the snow was covering his knees he was still with reverence standing in the snow

69
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:02,400
waiting for the master to speak to him the master ignored him for many many days finally to express

70
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:10,160
his sincerity in trying to find the dharma he cut his left arm the blood splashed everywhere

71
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:17,520
on the snow that's when bodhidharma asked him what do you want huike said your disciples mind

72
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:25,680
has no peace as yet master please put it to rest bodhidharma said bring me your mind

73
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:35,360
i will put it to rest huike said i have searched for my mind i cannot find it then bodhidharma

74
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:44,400
said i have completely put it to rest for you at that moment just one sentence with the master

75
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,680
he was completely enlightened and he became the

76
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:56,560
second patriarch of zen buddhism so he completely let go of his attachment to his body to his

77
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:03,440
feelings to his perception his mental formation his consciousness that's why he was able to let

78
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:11,040
go of his arm we're not asking you to have this kind of resolution but at least stop complaining

79
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:17,440
about your human existence little pain in the body here and there or how bad you feel

80
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:17,680
or

81
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:25,200
how horrible your life is if you keep thinking the human thoughts with your human mind

82
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:32,560
it's not gonna bring you into enlightenment stop thinking in terms of the five aggregates

83
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:39,920
attaching to the aggregate will only cause you to stay in the reincarnation we must have firm

84
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:47,440
resolution the second resolution you should carefully consider the origin of a fiction

85
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:54,160
and the beginningless creation of karma and perpetuation of rebirth

86
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:01,520
who creates it and who endures it the second question you must ponder upon it deeply

87
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:10,800
what is the origin of your afflictions why do you keep having greed anger and ignorance it is very

88
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:17,280
painful you don't know how to stop it you don't even know how to cultivate how to change yourself

89
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:24,360
you don't know the origin of your afflictions. So Buddha asked us to figure it out. What

90
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:32,800
is the origin? Why do you keep having reincarnation lifetime after lifetime? Who is creating this

91
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:41,480
affliction that's causing samsara and who is enduring the samsara? It is you. But what

92
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:48,340
about you that is causing it? What is the root? So Buddha tells us the answer. The origin

93
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:57,240
of your affliction is actually your sixth sense organs. Your eyes, your ears, your nose,

94
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:05,260
your tongue, your body and your mind. That is the origin of your afflictions. You don't

95
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:11,460
even know that. You never thought your sixth sense organs are the thief, the thief of your

96
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:17,700
life, that's stealing your treasure at home. We have the Buddha nature at home. But the

97
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:25,200
thief is stealing it. We call it the thieving matchmaker that's plundering the jewels of

98
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:31,480
your household. Why do we call it the thieving matchmaker? It's like the agent. You have

99
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:40,840
the external sixth sense objects, the outside thieves of sight, sound, smell, taste, touch

100
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,440
and dharma.

101
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:48,060
We have the agent, the organs in between. Then we have the inner thieves, the sixth

102
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:53,580
sense consciousness, the eye consciousness, ear consciousness, nose consciousness, all

103
00:08:53,580 --> 00:09:01,280
the way to the mind consciousness. That is the problem. Now we have to cultivate. Start

104
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:08,340
cultivating from here. This is where we fall. This is where we get up. So what we need to

105
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,840
do is to untie the knot.

106
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:16,900
Of our sixth sense organs. If you don't know where the knots are, how are you going to

107
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:24,640
untie it? So the knots are in the sixth sense organs. We need to untie them. Pick a sense

108
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:34,760
organ to return from. The sutra teaches to pick the ears. Just like Guan Yin Bodhisattva.

109
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:39,840
She became enlightened by cultivating her hearing. She entered the fruit of the Bodhisattva.

110
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,840
She became enlightened by cultivating her hearing. She entered the fruit of the Bodhisattva.

111
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:48,300
She flowed through hearing and forgot all objective states. She was able to let go

112
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:57,200
of all the sens. She does not hear the outside sounds anymore. She hears it, but is not caught

113
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:05,020
up with it. Her mind is always inward toward her true buddha nature. She has an owner at

114
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:10,720
home. It's not we don't hear, we don't see anymore, we closed everything. No, we still

115
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:17,900
see we still hear but we collect them inward we are still intact at home your

116
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:24,700
shelter from the outside wind and the storm all the outside conditions should

117
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:31,000
not affect your peace of mind should not affect your samadhi should not affect

118
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,060
your presence and your emotions if your emotions are always controlled by the

119
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:43,000
outside experience you will never become enlightened so you must collect them

120
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,220
inward you still see you still hear but you always have an owner guarding it at

121
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:56,460
home you're not completely going out to experience the world like a wild kid

122
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:02,820
doesn't know how to come home we know how to come back we always stay at home

123
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,900
experiencing the world as a person who has

124
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,040
something to do with the world and the world is not a place for you to be

125
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:15,500
this inner awakening extract one organ from adhesion free it subdue it from its

126
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:23,400
inner core once subdued it will return to the inherent truth and radiate the

127
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:30,860
inner brilliance we just need to extract one organ for example the ears from its

128
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:36,880
adhesion to sound free it and subdue it once it's subdued from the

129
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:43,060
inner core our true buddha nature will surface we will glow with the inner

130
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:49,900
brilliance in conclusion reject production and extinction and uphold

131
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:58,880
true permanence reject all rising and seizing any conditioned appearance such

132
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:06,720
as the five aggregate or the six sense organs let them go reject all the conditioned existence

133
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:14,120
and we uphold the true permanence there is something that is permanent not

134
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:20,160
moving with the external condition that is our true nature that is perfectly

135
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:27,560
tranquil and pure and calm that's where we should reside so we need to let go of

136
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:33,720
our attachment to the five aggregates because that is not the right cause

137
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,200
ground let go of the selfish싱

138
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,520
ground let go of the selfish

139
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:45,360
self the selfish eye let them go one layer at a time like peeling off an onion first detach

140
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:52,800
ourselves from our body it's not permanent it's not me do not be attached to our feelings of

141
00:12:52,800 --> 00:13:00,240
pleasure displeasure don't be attached to our thinking our concepts our ideas don't be attached

142
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:07,760
to the strong sense of self don't be attached to our consciousness none of them is me this is to

143
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:16,960
peel one layer at a time and the sixth organ is to pick one if you can just purify one and all of

144
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:25,280
them will be pure simultaneously this is the secret to our cultivation we are not really

145
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:29,760
cultivating until we have these two resolutions

146
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,880
Now we know Buddhism is like someone is giving us a mansion.

147
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,060
There's so many windows and doors,

148
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,460
but we don't know how to get in.

149
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,940
No matter how much sutra you read,

150
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,060
how much you cultivate, how much you meditate,

151
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,940
you don't know how to get into this house.

152
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,860
Even if you buy all the furniture,

153
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,220
try to decorate it by doing a lot of practice,

154
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,000
you are still outside.

155
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,600
You are still in the wind.

156
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,220
You're still under the rain.

157
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,540
You're still homeless.

158
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,560
You are not inside yet.

159
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,320
You need to make these two resolutions.

160
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,380
Stop chasing the selfish self.

161
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,540
Stop following with your sense organs.

162
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:16,300
Go inward to your true self, to your true permanence.

163
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,240
Then you can get into the house.

164
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,140
That's when your cultivation and the certification

165
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:27,280
of the ground of fruition will be complete,

166
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,300
which is real Buddhahood.

167
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:29,340
Hopefully.

168
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,980
You've figured out how to cultivate

169
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,940
and the problem that is stopping you

170
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,500
from improving this lifetime.

171
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,960
So that's the class for today.

172
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,080
Thank you for listening.

173
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,920
Amitabha.
