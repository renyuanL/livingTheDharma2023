1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,560
Today we are going to talk about Great Strength Bodhisattva's Perfect Penetration.

2
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,520
This is part of the Shakyamuni Sutra and is also considered one of the five main Pure Land

3
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,520
Sutra.

4
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:34,040
Amitabha, Guanyin Bodhisattva and Great Strength Bodhisattva are called the Three Sages of the

5
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,700
Western Pure Land.

6
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,480
Great Strength Bodhisattva is called Great Strength because of his virtue and wisdom.

7
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:47,080
He is so powerful whenever he raises his hand, moves his feet, the entire earth shakes and

8
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,080
trembles.

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:53,980
In the beginning of the Sutra, it says Dharma Prince Great Strength together with fifty-two

10
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:59,860
Bodhisattva of similar rank arose from his seat, bowed at the Buddha's feet and said

11
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,860
to the Buddha,

12
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:08,540
I remember when as many eons ago as there are sands in the Ganges, a Buddha called Limitless

13
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,200
Light appeared in the world.

14
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,160
In that same eon there were twelve successive Thus Come Ones.

15
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,160
The last was called Light Surpassing the Sun and the Moon.

16
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,160
That Buddha taught me the Buddha Resonates with the Sun and the Moon.

17
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,160
The last was called Light Surpassing the Sun and the Moon.

18
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,160
That Buddha taught me the Buddha Resonates with the Sun and the Moon.

19
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,160
The last was called Light Surpassing the Sun and the Moon.

20
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,160
The last was called Light Surpassing the Sun and the Moon.

21
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,160
The last was called Light Surpassing the Sun and the Moon.

22
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,160
Then Buddha recitation Samadhi.

23
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,460
Great Strength Bodhisattva is called the Dharma Prince because he's someone who is going to

24
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,520
inherit the throne and reach Buddhahood.

25
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:42,020
He and fifty-two Bodhisattva, they are basically people who are practicing the same Bodhisattva

26
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,040
way of chanting Amitabha Buddha's name.

27
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,300
That's how they become enlightened.

28
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,960
They are all fellow classmates.

29
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,040
They rose from their seat to describe how they met Buddha.

30
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,040
They are all fellow classmates.

31
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:58,760
how they reach Samadhi. Many eons ago, there was a limitless light Buddha. It's the same

32
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:05,760
name as Amitabha Buddha whose name means infinite light. The last Buddha was called Light Surpassing

33
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:12,280
the Sun and the Moon. He taught Great String Bodhisattva the Buddha recitation Samadhi.

34
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:20,340
Samadhi means proper concentration. When you can concentrate your mind on the name Amitabha,

35
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:28,120
you can reach enlightenment. That's what Great String Bodhisattva did. So he is trying to explain

36
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:35,480
how he reached enlightenment to us. He used two analogies. Suppose there were a person who always

37
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:42,340
remembers someone else, but the someone else he remembers has entirely forgotten about him.

38
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:49,540
One person keeps thinking about someone else, but that someone else forgot about him.

39
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,300
This

40
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:57,300
person is Amitabha Buddha. He is always thinking about us, but we always forget about him.

41
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:05,480
We always turn our back on Amitabha. We follow the Sixth Sense Objects of the world. Even

42
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:12,800
if we are Pure Land Practitioners, we might chant one hour a day, but 23 hours, we are

43
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:19,040
minding our own business and we forgot about him. But if two such people were to meet,

44
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,140
even if they were to meet, they would never forget about him. They would never forget about him.

45
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,140
They would never take notice. No oneารat problema. They would not figure out the meaning put into their words.

46
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,020
They would not recognize each other. A lot of times, people are afraid or touch Gracias."

47
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,940
That's going to reassure the third relation. They would not recognize each other.

48
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:32,540
A lot of times, we feel lonely, afraid, and fearful. That's because we don't know

49
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:39,480
Amitabha is with us all the time. We are never alone. It's always us and Amitabha, but we

50
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:45,940
don't recognize him. That's why we don't know his presence. He is always with us. We should

51
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,940
never be alone.

52
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,260
If two people remember each other until the Wednesday morning, We are in no hurry. As the

53
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:47,420
politics are changing, some people might break into the regulations. I feel happy as they did.

54
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:47,720
Learn about Chinese Yoga will help you learn Chinese Yoga in your life.

55
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,780
people remember each other until the memory of each is deep then in life

56
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:58,040
after life they will be together like a form and its shadow and they will never

57
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:04,820
be at odds on the other hand if they always remember each other if I remember

58
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:11,300
Amitabha and Amitabha of course always remembering me our memory of each other

59
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:17,000
is very deep always thinking of each other then we will be together like an

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,640
object in the shadow and we will never be in opposition or in conflict we

61
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:29,260
always together in our heart last summer we went to a vegetarian restaurant after

62
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,020
we're done eating but they had to go to the restaurant so we were waiting

63
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:38,880
outside in the parking lot there came a monk I immediately bow to him and he

64
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,120
started telling me about the Dharma how to cultivate the mind and the body and

65
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,940
our speech he went to his car and took a

66
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:46,980
car and took a car and took a car and took a car and took a car and took a

67
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,400
car and took a car and took a car and took a car and took a car and took a

68
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:53,020
big picture of Shakyamuni Buddha and said here this is for you I was so happy

69
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:58,860
and this all happened in the parking lot of a restaurant I don't know his name he

70
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:04,040
doesn't know my name but we are connected in the Dharma this is the law

71
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,740
of attraction whatever you think about all day long that's what you will

72
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:15,000
attract into your life so we need to think about Amitabha all day long the

73
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,920
other example is Amitabha.

74
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,360
Out of pity for living beings that thus come once of the Ten Directions,

75
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,680
are mindful of them as a mother remembers her child.

76
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,560
If a child runs away, of what use is the mother's regard?

77
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,880
Buddha is like the mother, and we are like the child.

78
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,160
If we don't remember him and run away from home,

79
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,480
then no matter how much the mother thinks of us, it's useless.

80
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,960
We'd rather be a beggar in the three worlds of samsara

81
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,680
and turn our backs on enlightenment.

82
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,520
That's how sad it is.

83
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,000
On the surface level, this mother is Amitabha Buddha.

84
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,840
On the deeper level, this mother is our original enlightened mind.

85
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,920
We all have it originally.

86
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,640
We should remember who we really are.

87
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,520
When we start chanting the name Amitabha,

88
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,320
that's the process of actualization

89
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:13,400
of the three worlds of samsara.

90
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:13,440
That's the process of actualization of the three worlds of samsara.

91
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:13,480
That's the process of actualization of the three worlds of samsara.

92
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,680
That's the process of actualization of enlightenment.

93
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,960
And then we will reach final enlightenment.

94
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,120
The original enlightenment,

95
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,480
and the process of actualization of enlightenment,

96
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,320
and the final enlightenment,

97
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,160
is all one enlightenment.

98
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,400
Because we just have one mind.

99
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,320
So know who we really are.

100
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,880
Do not run away from your own ultimate nature.

101
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,680
But if the child remembers his mother

102
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,360
in the same way that the mother remembers the child,

103
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,400
then in life,

104
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,200
after life,

105
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,440
the mother and the child will not be far apart.

106
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,880
If the child always remembers the mother,

107
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,000
then they will be together forever.

108
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,720
If we remember our true nature,

109
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,120
either we are walking,

110
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,240
standing,

111
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,120
sitting,

112
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,320
lying down,

113
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,120
remember we are the Buddha.

114
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,600
We are the same as Amitabha.

115
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,080
Have Amitabha in our mind,

116
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,240
and be mindful of the present moment,

117
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,080
of what we are doing.

118
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,760
So walk like a Buddha,

119
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,360
stand like a Buddha,

120
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,880
sit like a Buddha,

121
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,720
lie down like a Buddha,

122
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,760
then you are the Buddha at this moment.

123
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,520
You don't have anywhere to go.

124
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,520
You don't have to look anywhere else.

125
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,360
You have already arrived.

126
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,080
That's what the Zen Buddhism is teaching us.

127
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,600
It is exactly the same as Pure Land Buddhism.

128
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,320
So there's actually no sex of Buddhism.

129
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,760
We are all together,

130
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,720
as one,

131
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,480
one whole Buddhism.

132
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,240
We can do this through chanting of Amitabha,

133
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,160
just remembering the Buddha.

134
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,200
Every breath,

135
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,640
we are the Buddha.

136
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,960
So remember the mother.

137
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,240
If living beings remember the Buddha,

138
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,480
and are mindful of the Buddha,

139
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:06,760
certainly they will see the Buddha now or in the future.

140
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,120
So this means we remember Amitabha.

141
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,360
It's not just chanting his name.

142
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,840
Actually know his heart,

143
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,360
know his vows,

144
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,800
and know his deeds,

145
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,320
and be like him.

146
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,360
Buddha's heart is full of compassion,

147
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,120
sincere,

148
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,080
and pure,

149
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,200
and enlightened.

150
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,080
His vow is to save all sentient beings.

151
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,440
We should have the same Bodhisattva vows.

152
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,920
And Buddha's deed is to follow the precepts exactly.

153
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,440
Then we should follow the precepts exactly.

154
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,280
That is called remembering,

155
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,360
remembering the Buddha,

156
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,120
mindful of the Buddha.

157
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,320
If you do that,

158
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,040
then you'll definitely see Buddha.

159
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,200
We will see Buddha in this lifetime in three ways.

160
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,120
One is in our dream.

161
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,880
Buddha might come into your dream to encourage you.

162
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,440
Two is when you're in deep meditation,

163
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,040
you can see Buddha.

164
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,680
Lastly,

165
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,880
you'll definitely see Buddha in the moment of death.

166
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,840
Amitabha will keep his promise,

167
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,520
he will keep his promise for you to his Western Pure Land.

168
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,680
So we'll definitely see him then.

169
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,760
And we will see him in the future.

170
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,080
That means in the Western Pure Land.

171
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,600
When your lotus flower opens up and you see him,

172
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,680
that's when you're really enlightened.

173
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,440
So if you remember Buddha,

174
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,000
you will see Buddha for sure.

175
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,400
If someone always remember the Buddha,

176
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,960
they will never be apart from the Buddha,

177
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:40,600
and their minds will awaken by themselves without the aid of expedience.

178
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,760
If we always remember the Buddha,

179
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,200
chant Buddha's name,

180
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,040
think of Buddha's virtues,

181
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,040
his mind and his vows,

182
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,480
then we will be awakened by ourselves.

183
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,560
How do we know if we're awakened?

184
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,960
When we eliminate our afflictions,

185
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:01,320
situation or affliction that's bothering us will disappear.

186
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,240
We will feel blissfulness and peace in our mind.

187
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,320
Then we know our heart has opened up and we are awakened.

188
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,520
We are one with the Buddha.

189
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:17,160
A person who has been near incense will carry a fragrance on his person.

190
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,440
It is called an adornment of fragrant light.

191
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,080
So if we chant Amitabha Buddha's name,

192
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,360
it's like we are always near incense.

193
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,840
We permeate with this fragrance.

194
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,000
We don't have to create this fragrance.

195
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,120
It's already created by Amitabha and will be glowing in his golden light.

196
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,120
Everybody that remembers him will have this golden light.

197
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,200
It will naturally manifest.

198
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,200
Great Saint Bodhisattva said on the castle ground,

199
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:52,680
I use the mindfulness of Buddha to enter into patience with non-protection of Dharma.

200
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,080
For his own self enlightenment,

201
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:01,880
he used the mindfulness of Buddha to reach the patience of non-protection of Dharma,

202
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:07,000
which means he understands the emptiness of the self and emptiness of all Dharma.

203
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,040
On the other hand,

204
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,880
to save all sentient beings,

205
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,440
he said,

206
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,960
now in this world,

207
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:18,520
I gather all those that are mindful of the Buddha and bring them back to the Western Pure Land.

208
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,040
He already made a vow.

209
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,240
In this world,

210
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,560
he will protect all those that chant Amitabha Buddha's name,

211
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,560
help them in their practice,

212
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,680
and at the end,

213
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,080
will bring them back to the Pure Land.

214
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,320
That's his Bodhisattva vow.

215
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,200
So he said,

216
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,000
Buddha asked about perfect penetration.

217
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,480
I was like none other than God,

218
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:47,720
then gather in the six organs through continuous pure mindfulness to obtain samadhi.

219
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,560
This is the foremost method.

220
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,160
So Buddha asked about how he became enlightened.

221
00:11:53,160 --> 00:12:00,280
He gathered in the six organs and have continuous pure mindfulness of the name Amitabha,

222
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,600
and that's how he obtained proper concentration,

223
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,720
samadhi.

224
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,840
That's the foremost method we can all use.

225
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:13,480
At least we can all reach continuous link recitation.

226
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:19,800
That means your recitation can go for a period of time without any interruption,

227
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,040
without any scattered thoughts.

228
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,240
If our recitation is not effective,

229
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:32,200
we need to find out the factor that is rendering the ineffectiveness of our Pure Land chanting.

230
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,960
So we need to find out why.

231
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:38,120
If it's a certain person or a certain situation,

232
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,480
that always take your mind away from your chanting,

233
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,160
realize that you are attached to the situation,

234
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,440
not to eliminate the situation or the person,

235
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,360
but to eliminate your attachment to the situation.

236
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,880
Know that it's all conditioned and non-existing.

237
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,840
Why are you bothered and carried away by the situation or this person?

238
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,400
You should come back to your Amitabha.

239
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,600
It is the only thing that should be on your mind,

240
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,960
24 hours a day,

241
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,160
know Amitabha and know you are with him.

242
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,560
Know that you are the Buddha nature.

243
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,480
That's all you have to remember.

244
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,000
That's the foremost important thing in our lives.

245
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,160
So understand what is Buddha recitation,

246
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,200
samadhi,

247
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,760
and if we really do this this lifetime,

248
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:31,640
our chanting will be effective and we will definitely go to the Western Pure Land.

249
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,080
So that's the class for today.

250
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,120
Thank you for listening.

251
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,080
Amitabha.
