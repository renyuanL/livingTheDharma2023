1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,980
Today we are going to talk about

2
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,980
uplifting our mind.

3
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,980
The reason we are meditating is to train our mind

4
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,980
to be in a state of happiness and calmness.

5
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,980
Everybody wants to be happy,

6
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,980
but how do we train our mind?

7
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,980
In the Sutra, we actually have five specific ways

8
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:48,980
to uplift our mind.

9
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,980
The blue are the direct translation,

10
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,980
the pink is the Chinese writing,

11
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,980
and the black is mind interpretation,

12
00:00:58,980 --> 00:00:59,980
for you to remember it.

13
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,980
So the first is called skill for desires.

14
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,980
How do you change your life to be better?

15
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,980
First, you've got to have a desire to do so.

16
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,980
How come our life is like this right now?

17
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,980
If you're not happy about it,

18
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,980
what can you do to change it?

19
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:16,980
First, you've got to have a desire,

20
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,980
I want to make my life better.

21
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,980
If this is not the life that you want,

22
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,980
you should have a longing,

23
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:23,980
I want to make it better.

24
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,980
It's not by changing the outside world,

25
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,980
it's by changing your mind to think positive,

26
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,980
then you can make your life much better.

27
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,980
So first, have a great desire to be better.

28
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,980
I don't know if you've heard of Roger Bannister.

29
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,980
He's a neurologist.

30
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:40,980
He's also a runner.

31
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,980
In 1954, scientists told everybody,

32
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:49,980
nobody can run the mile under four minutes.

33
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,980
So everybody thought it's impossible

34
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,980
because our body is impossible

35
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,980
to run a mile under four minutes.

36
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:57,980
Roger, he said to himself,

37
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,980
I am going to set a goal.

38
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,980
I'm going to run the mile

39
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,980
less than four minutes.

40
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,980
On May 6th of 1954,

41
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:09,980
he did it.

42
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:14,980
He did the mile in 3 minutes and 59 seconds.

43
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,980
And guess what?

44
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,980
46 days after that,

45
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,980
someone else did it too.

46
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,980
And then a couple months later,

47
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:22,980
more people did it.

48
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,980
Did everybody's body change?

49
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:26,980
No.

50
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,980
It's what?

51
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,980
It's the mind.

52
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,980
Then people start running the mile under four minutes.

53
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,980
The miracle is created by our own goal setting

54
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:36,980
and we want to do it.

55
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:37,980
If you have the desire to do it,

56
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:38,980
you can do anything.

57
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,980
First, have a skillful desire

58
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,980
to change your life to be better.

59
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,980
The second is right effort.

60
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,980
You set your goal,

61
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,980
you've got to work hard at it.

62
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:51,980
You've got to be diligent.

63
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,980
That's why we have to meditate.

64
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,980
This diligence is not just keep meditating.

65
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,980
Meditating is just a short period of time.

66
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,980
The true diligence is when you're constantly

67
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,980
watching your mind.

68
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,980
Be aware of your thoughts.

69
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,980
Constantly aware.

70
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,980
What am I thinking?

71
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,980
Am I being positive?

72
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,980
Am I living the life that I want?

73
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,980
So always think of thoughts

74
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,980
that would be beneficial to you.

75
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,980
By diligent,

76
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,980
I mean focusing on each breath.

77
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,980
Each breath.

78
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,980
So every inhale,

79
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,980
every exhale,

80
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,980
you've got to be diligent

81
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,980
to be positive.

82
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,980
Even when you're not meditating,

83
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:34,980
you're at work,

84
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,980
you're doing anything,

85
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,980
can you focus on your breath

86
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,980
and be mindful?

87
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:40,980
What am I doing today?

88
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,980
Is this what I want to do?

89
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:43,980
Am I doing this right?

90
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,980
Am I living on purpose?

91
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,980
Be diligent with every breath.

92
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,980
And the third is right mindfulness.

93
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:52,980
With diligence,

94
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,980
you will be mindful.

95
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,980
Be mindful of what?

96
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,980
Be mindful of positive thinking.

97
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,980
Are you mindful of how you think?

98
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,980
All of us,

99
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,980
we have a mode of thinking.

100
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,980
We have a way of thinking.

101
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,980
And a lot of us,

102
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,980
we have very negative thoughts.

103
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,980
I'm not good enough.

104
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:11,980
I'm not pretty enough.

105
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,980
I'm not good at this.

106
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:14,980
I'm horrible.

107
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,980
I can't do this.

108
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,980
A lot of us have a lot of patterns

109
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,980
of negative thinking

110
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,980
and we are not even aware of it.

111
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:21,980
So be mindful.

112
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,980
The right mindfulness

113
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,980
means you got to stay positive all the time.

114
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,980
How you think is what you create for yourself.

115
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,980
It's how your life will be.

116
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,980
So thinking positively all the time

117
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,980
is actually the way of true deep concentration

118
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,980
or true samadhi,

119
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,980
as we call it,

120
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:40,980
deep meditation.

121
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,980
You should be mindful all the time.

122
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,980
Then you'll be able to change the reality

123
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:46,980
you're living in.

124
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,980
Especially,

125
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,980
you can change your body.

126
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,980
There was a man that he had terminal illness.

127
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,980
He was on his deathbed in the hospital.

128
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,980
He thought he was going to die soon.

129
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,980
One night,

130
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,980
he had a dream.

131
00:04:58,980 --> 00:04:59,980
He dreamt,

132
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,980
someone told him,

133
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,980
the tree outside of your window,

134
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,980
when all the leaves are gone,

135
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,980
that would be your last day.

136
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,980
That would be your last day.

137
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,980
So he woke up very sad outside the window.

138
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,980
There's a tree with a few leaves.

139
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,980
And then a very kind doctor came in

140
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,980
and asked him what was wrong.

141
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,980
He said,

142
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:19,980
oh, I had this dream.

143
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:20,980
And the doctor said,

144
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,980
oh, not to worry.

145
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,980
A few days later,

146
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,980
there was a big storm.

147
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,980
So at night,

148
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:26,980
he was really worried.

149
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,980
He said,

150
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:28,980
oh, next morning,

151
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:29,980
there's going to be no leaves left.

152
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,980
It's going to be my last day.

153
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,980
And the next morning,

154
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,980
guess what?

155
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,980
The nice doctor came in

156
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,980
and then he said,

157
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:37,980
hey, look,

158
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,980
there's a whole bunch of leaves still hanging there.

159
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,980
That means you're going to have a miracle.

160
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,980
Something's going to happen to you.

161
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,980
Your disease will have a turn point.

162
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,980
You're going to get better.

163
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,980
After that day,

164
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,980
because he believed in it,

165
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,980
he kept getting better.

166
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,980
And,

167
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,980
he was cured.

168
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,980
And he left the hospital.

169
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,980
How did this happen?

170
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,980
Because he believed.

171
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,980
He used his thoughts to be positive

172
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,980
and he changed his body

173
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,980
and changed his life.

174
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,980
Why this story is so touching?

175
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,980
Because the doctor

176
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,980
actually glued those leaves on.

177
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:14,980
Yeah, it's not real.

178
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,980
Because the doctor's being nice

179
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,980
because he knew it was going to fall off.

180
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,980
But, you know,

181
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,980
he glued it on.

182
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:21,980
So,

183
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,980
you're not going to die.

184
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,980
You're going to stay positive at all times.

185
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:25,980
And that will make you

186
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:26,980
have a very different life.

187
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,980
The fourth one is

188
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,980
skillful insight.

189
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,980
Insight means wisdom.

190
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,980
Do you have the wisdom

191
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,980
to lead a happy life?

192
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,980
Wisdom means the ability to choose.

193
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,980
Do I choose to be positive

194
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,980
or do I choose to be negative?

195
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,980
Do I choose to think I live in a world

196
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:47,980
that's hostile

197
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,980
and everybody is mean to me

198
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:50,980
or do I choose to live in a world

199
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:56,320
choose to live in a world that everybody is in harmony and likes me then you will be living in

200
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:02,720
a different world there's a lumberjack he has a axe one day he lost it he doesn't know where he

201
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:09,020
left it so he was looking at the neighbor's kid this boy he's like oh he looked very suspicious

202
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:16,960
i think he stole it so every day so this few days he kept thinking the boy stole my axe he saw the

203
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:23,580
boy talking to his mom and he's like oh they must be thinking of how to sell my axe for money you

204
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:29,180
know for money the more he thought about the more upset he was you know it ruined his life one day

205
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:37,420
again he went to the forest by the river he found his axe so was this stolen by the boy

206
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:45,540
no but at this whole time he kept thinking the boy stole it so if you can change your way to be wise

207
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,940
and not be foolish

208
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:54,440
you can live a much better life by thinking positive okay the fifth one is single-mindedness

209
00:07:54,440 --> 00:08:00,500
actually all five they kind of go together the more desire you have the more you put in effort

210
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:06,800
the more mindful you are the more wisdom you have the more you will be determined you'll be getting

211
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:13,620
better at it because you're fully concentrated on your goal this is full determination on how i want

212
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,940
to make my life better this determination

213
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,920
you want to make your life better you want to make your life better you want to make your life better

214
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:23,240
you want to make sure you are very firm in what you believe believe it wholeheartedly your heart is

215
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,600
like a diamond nobody can shake you like you burn a diamond it's still a diamond your belief should

216
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:35,080
be as strong as the diamond there was a lady in singapore she lived to be a hundred and fourteen

217
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:43,000
she's like the oldest asian lady that ever lived she never learned how to read or write until 47.

218
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,880
she wanted to be a nurse so i want to help people

219
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:55,200
i want to be a nurse so at 47 she went to oxford university and got her nursing degree ever since

220
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,060
then she became the greatest social worker when she was like 100 something she established a

221
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:08,520
senior home for seniors that much younger than her so she lived to be 114 and she said my role

222
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:15,460
model for life is i have no religion love is my religion i don't care who the person is i love

223

224

225
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:30,500
great life up to 114. your determination really makes up who you are that's the fifth way to
