00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,140
Today's topic is Mind Only Contemplation.

2
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:24,380
This is verses from Mahayana Sangreya by Bodhisattva Asanga.

3
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:29,120
We want to untie our minds from impediments.

4
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:35,920
This involves deep insight meditation such as this mind only meditation.

5
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,920
So let's look at this verse.

6
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,640
The concentrated Bodhisattva sees that the images are mind only.

7
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:51,520
This concentrated Bodhisattva which is someone who has deep meditation absorption.

8
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:59,100
Someone who is able to see the truth that everything is only false images created by this mind.

9
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:06,900
In this structure, Bodhisattva Asanga delved deep into our alaya consciousness.

10
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,520
This big storehouse contains all our karmic seeds.

11
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,700
When the conditions are right, it will ripen into results.

12
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,120
That's all the phenomenons of this world.

13
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,820
So everything is only creation by our mind.

14
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,500
The three realms is created by our minds.

15
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:32,180
My ray Dharma originates from this mind.

16
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:37,100
All circumstances are only perceptions from our mind.

17
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,640
Nothing is real.

18
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,900
It's only phantasm and magical delusion.

19
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:49,840
We often use the metaphor mistaken a rope for a snake in the darkness.

20
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,380
When we see the snake and we are afraid, that's our false imagination.

21
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,300
A Bodhisattva in deep consciousness.

22
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,620
They will not see the snake.

23
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,800
They will see it's only a rope.

24
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:10,180
Us mundane, we might be in fear, not knowing that this snake never really existed.

25
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:18,920
This snake can be our poverty, our sickness, our afflictions, a concentrated Bodhisattva.

26
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:25,980
He rejects the notion of the snake, knowing it's only a false image created by our consciousness.

27
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:26,980
The notion of the snake is not real.

28
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,840
The notion of things have been expelled.

29
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,180
He sees that only his mind exists.

30
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,220
We are seeing the false image.

31
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,160
It's only a magical delusion, a trick of the mind.

32
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:49,140
In the Consciousness Only School of Buddhism, we categorize everything in the Dharma world

33
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,420
as the three natures.

34
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,300
One is the fully conceptualized nature.

35
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,300
That's all our deluded thinking.

36
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,760
Our wandering thoughts.

37
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,420
Second is the other-dependent nature.

38
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:06,800
That's all the karma that we are experiencing in our lives right now.

39
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,300
The third is the fully accomplished nature.

40
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,920
That's our true suchness.

41
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,540
The snake that we think exists is the fully conceptualized nature.

42
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:23,160
If we can see that it's only a rope, that's the other-dependent nature.

43
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,940
On another level.

44
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,200
If we can see.

45
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:32,240
That the rope is made out of different kind of thread, that's seeing the fully accomplished

46
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,240
nature.

47
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,800
The other example that we use is a dream.

48
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,660
The plot in the dream is the other-dependent nature.

49
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,600
We are living the dream itself.

50
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,160
That's the fully conceptualized nature.

51
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:53,460
If we know it's only a dream, then that's the fully accomplished nature.

52
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,960
It all depends on our wisdom.

53
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:03,380
If we can see that the world is only a magical delusion, why should we be worried and caught

54
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,740
up with everything that's going on in the world?

55
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:12,580
Master Wang Qing, he was out of the solitude, up in the cave of the mountain.

56
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:20,060
He came back to the temple, often just sat in the main hall and meditated.

57
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,880
One day, all the donation in the donation box disappeared.

58
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,880
Everybody was gone.

59
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:35,060
Everybody thought he had stolen all the donation, but he was not moved at all by this circumstance.

60
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,800
This has no bearing on his emotions.

61
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,540
After a couple of weeks, people at the temple announced that they actually hid the money

62
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:48,900
just to test the old monk's cultivation.

63
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,820
Everybody started praising him.

64
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:54,920
Again, Master Wang Qing was not moved by this circumstance.

65
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,840
Master Wang Qing was not moved by this circumstance.

66
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,040
He added here, in his ???

67
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,840
In his book, in the book of

68
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:05,840
Master Wang Qing, he said this,

69
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:13,160
This requires knowing that everything is made from the mind only and everything you see doesn't

70
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,160
really exist.

71
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,160
This required knowing that everything is made from the mind only and everything you see

72
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,160
doesn't really exist.

73
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,160
Now, let's look at the third line.

74
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,160
Now, let's look at the third line.

75
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,160
Abiding, thus, in the inner mind.

76
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,720
He knows that the object of perception does not exist.

77
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,720
Then, when the subject of perception is in the inner mind, he knows that the object of

78
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,720
perception does not exist.

79
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:34,720
perception as well does not exist. Later, he contacts the emptiness of non-perception.

80
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:43,940
There are three things here. One is the object of perception. Two is the subject of perception.

81
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:53,540
The third is the emptiness of non-perception. Our mind works in subject and object. We have

82
00:05:53,540 --> 00:06:04,180
object of perception such as the sixth sense objects of sight, sound, smell, taste, touch,

83
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:12,060
and the Dharma. That's the object of our perception. The subject of perception is our sixth sense

84
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:21,660
consciousness, our eye consciousness, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. The mind always

85
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,480
works in subject and object.

86
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:23,520
Subjects touch and objects touch. So our mind always works in subject and object. Our

87
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:32,480
an object. That's how we think and have deluded thinking. But a bodhisattva, they dwell in

88
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:40,400
their inner mind. They know the emptiness of all things and they also know the object

89
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:47,480
of perception and the subject of perception are all created by the mind. None of them

90
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:55,660
really exists. He investigates even further to get to this reality. When we reach this

91
00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:06,340
level, at the end, we will see the emptiness of non-perception. The idea of non-perception

92
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:16,480
or nothing existing also is expelled at the end. Therefore, there is no existence or non-existence.

93
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,480
That's the original question.

94
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:27,640
The essence of our mind is unfold. That's our true suchness. We call it the fully accomplished

95
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:39,520
nature. As you can see, this mind-only meditation is in many steps of letting go. Seeing that

96
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:47,480
all images are mind-only, seeing the object of perception does not exist, the subject

97
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:52,700
of perception does not exist, theReally. At the end, the emptiness of non-perception

98
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:57,640
doesn't exist either. At the end, that's when we see the true.

99
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:08,060
The intention of this insight meditation involves four investigations and four precise

100
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:17,280
knowledges. The four investigations is to delve deep into all these four concepts. The

101
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:26,300
First is the name of all things. We give everything a name such as fire. Fire is a name. It's

102
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:34,520
also a thing. It has meaning. It has a self-nature. It's heat. It has temperature. And it has

103
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:42,660
characteristics. We use it to burn. We need to investigate into these four qualities.

104
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:49,620
The name, the thing, the self-nature, the characteristics. When you delve deep into

105
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:57,140
it, then you will realize they're non-existent. Nothing really existed in the first place.

106
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:05,660
It's all concept of the mind. For example, anger. We give it a name called anger. It

107
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:12,640
is a thing. It is an emotion. It is an affliction. Then it has self-nature. The thing is a thing.

108
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:12,660
The thing is a thing. The thing is a thing. The thing is a thing. The thing is a thing.

109
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:23,180
The self-nature of anger is suffering. Because we sense suffering, we become upset. Its characteristics

110
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:32,600
destroys our peace of mind. It destroys all our goodness. That's the meaning of anger.

111
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:39,700
But when you delve deep into it, you will realize anger never really existed. And you

112
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,640
can delve even further to see the meaning of anger.

113
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:50,160
We believe that this anger is only a concept of the mind. It has no real rising or ceasing.

114
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:59,340
We can investigate. Before the anger ever existed, there was nothing. Because of a situation,

115
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:07,680
we want to get angry. There was nothing either. And right now, when I'm angry, there's

116
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,620
also nothing to be found.

117
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:24,780
At the end, this affliction called anger never really rises. Therefore, letting it go is

118
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:31,680
not a problem at all. Because it's only a concept of the mind.

119
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,900
Investigate everything in this matter until you are very firm.

120
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:42,600
The first two lines is when we have the four investigations.

121
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:49,120
The first two lines is when we are so sure there's nonexistence about these four things,

122
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,520
that we don't know the true meaning of anger.

123
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,340
It's called the four precise knowledges.

124
00:10:54,340 --> 00:11:01,720
When we are so sure, we have this deep concentration. Concentrate on the fact that it is merely

125
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:07,760
the mind only. Nothing really existed. We want to gain this true wisdom and really see

126
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,080
through things.

127
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,080
The four investigations.

128
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,080
The four precise knowledges.

129
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,080
The four precise knowledges.

130
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:18,300
precise knowledges they are exactly the same thing it just one goes into a

131
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:26,580
deeper level that is all that is what we call meditative absorption the further

132
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:33,680
you go down the further you let go the further you see the emptiness of all

133
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:39,980
things and the emptiness of the mind you will see the truth so at the end you

134
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:47,420
will see that the mind doesn't exist either because the mind cannot see the

135
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:55,740
mind just like a knife cannot cut itself eyes cannot see the eyes itself at the

136
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:02,240
end you will let go the object and the subject the mind itself doesn't exist

137
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:08,120
that's why it's the emptiness of non-perception that's when we see the

138
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,840
real truth

139
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:16,260
so if we can see this we will not be concerned so much about what's going on

140
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:22,100
in the world really let go of our attachments that's when our bodhisattvas

141
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:28,980
practice the six pyramidas in real life they have no attachment to

142
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:35,860
the person that they're giving to to the things they're giving and to themselves

143
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,840
identify as a giver when they are practicing

144
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:46,640
patience, they don't have to say I'm being patient or I'm having forbearance because

145
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:54,080
they don't even have this concept of tolerance because all things they are fabrication of

146
00:12:54,080 --> 00:13:01,840
the mind. That's when Bodhisattva, their mind is undivided and without perplexity.

147
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:09,680
That's what we call deep meditative absorption. Go through these steps when we chant the name

148
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:17,920
Amitabha. This will be true recitation of the Buddha's name. Take care of business and

149
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:25,760
let it go. We don't keep anything in our mind, then we can chant Buddha's name single-mindedly.

150
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:32,600
At the end of our lives, we can let go of all attachment even to our family and loved

151
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:39,660
ones without any obstacles. Going to the Western Pure Land, that's when we can really

152
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:45,560
be out of the Sixth Round of Incarnation. Don't let everything be hanged up in your

153
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:54,040
mind. It does cause vexation for yourself. We do not want to be under the whims of others.

154
00:13:54,040 --> 00:14:01,260
Discard all distinction between good and bad. That's what we call mindlessness. It's not

155
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:09,340
we are indifferent. It means we are letting go all our senses of discrimination. This

156
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:09,460
is called mindlessness.

157
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:17,040
This is called true samadhi. It's called the mind-only contemplation in everyday life.

158
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:27,160
Walking, standing, eating, sleeping, anything we do, we must know that it's all mind-only.

159
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:36,220
That way, the external circumstances will have no bearing on your emotion or your mind.

160
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,340
So that's the class for today. Thank you for listening. Amitabha.
