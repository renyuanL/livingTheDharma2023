1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,360
Today we will talk about one moment of thought.

2
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,400
The power of our minds is inconceivable.

3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,600
We will discuss the Amitabha Sutra to understand the power of our minds.

4
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:32,000
In the commentary of Amitabha Sutra by Master O.E., it asks a question.

5
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:38,900
If Amitabha's pure land is a hundred billion worlds away from here, how can we be reborn there instantly?

6
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,940
Master O.E. answered, a hundred billion worlds are not beyond one moment of thought,

7
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:49,520
since fundamentally there is nothing outside the true mind.

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,520
From the aspect of phenomena, a hundred billion Buddha lands away is inconceivable.

9
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:05,600
However, from the aspect of noumenon, the principle, the pure land is already within our true nature.

10
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,600
The mundane only understand the world of phenomena, the physical world,

11
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:17,600
but the saints and sages, they live in the world of noumenon, the mind, the non-physical.

12
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,600
Therefore, one moment we are aligned back to our pure enlightened mind,

13
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,600
then we already arrive at the pure land.

14
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,600
For example, if we close our eyes, think about the person we despise,

15
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,600
we're immediately with the person, feeling the anger.

16
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,600
If we think about the person we love and adore, we immediately feel happiness.

17
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,600
If we think about this new land, we're immediately there having fun.

18
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,600
If we think about the western pure land, our mind is already back to the pure land.

19
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,600
Our mind creates the pure land.

20
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,600
It creates our reality.

21
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,600
When we rely on the power of Buddha that is inherent in our own mind,

22
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,600
what is so hard about being reborn in the pure land instantly?

23
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,600
There are two important powers in the pure land Buddhism.

24
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,600
One is the power of Amitabha, the Buddha.

25
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,600
Two is the power of our own mind.

26
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:22,600
When we chant the name Amitabha, Amitabha's power immediately merges into ours,

27
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,600
because we all have the same nature.

28
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,600
In the Thrice Yearning Chanting Service of Master Dongfeng,

29
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,600
it says cheese and yogurt are cultivated from milk.

30
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,600
You and Buddha have the same nature.

31
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,600
Bracelets and golden vases are fabricated from gold.

32
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,600
The Buddha is the Buddha because of the heart.

33
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,600
A hundred billion worlds away, from east to west, 24 hours a day,

34
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,600
mortals and saints all start from the same point.

35
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,600
There are two metaphors here.

36
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Buddha is like the cheese, we are like the yogurt,

37
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,600
both made out of milk, which is the same Buddha nature.

38
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,600
The other example, Buddha is like the gold bracelets,

39
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,600
we are like the gold vases, both made out of gold, which is the Buddha nature.

40
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,600
We all have the Buddha heart.

41
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,600
So a hundred billion Buddhas land away is not apart from our true mind,

42
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,600
and 24 hours a day is not apart from this one moment of thought.

43
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,600
Our mind is beyond time and space,

44
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,600
because our mind has no limitation or boundary.

45
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,600
When it further explains,

46
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:37,600
it is like many layered scenes of mountains, rivers, and towers reflected in a mirror.

47
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,600
All the layers appear there in the mirror,

48
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,600
and in reality there is no near and far.

49
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,600
All are reflected at once, appear without before and after.

50
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:57,600
The name Amitabha symbolizes infinite light and infinite life.

51
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,600
Infinite light means it extends throughout all ten directions,

52
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:08,600
and infinite life means it extends throughout all periods of time.

53
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:14,600
So this Buddha name, it means our Buddha nature is beyond time and space.

54
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,600
And here it uses the example of mirror.

55
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,600
This mirror is like our true mind,

56
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,600
and the many layered scenes is like the scenery of the Pure Land.

57
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,600
When our mind is calm and unmoved like the perfect mirror,

58
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,600
the Pure Land is immediately reflected in our heart.

59
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,600
In terms of space, there is no near and far,

60
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,600
and in terms of time, there is no before and after,

61
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,600
just like the name infinite light and infinite life.

62
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,600
So there is no resistance or no limitation here

63
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,600
when we are back in our true nature.

64
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,600
Moreover, it talks about four important passages of the Amitabha Sutra.

65
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,600
When the Sutra says west of here, past a hundred billion Buddha lands,

66
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,600
there exists a world called ultimate bliss.

67
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
It is also like this.

68
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,600
When the Sutra says in this land,

69
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,600
there exists a Buddha called Amitabha,

70
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,600
who is expanding the Dharma right now.

71
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
It is also like this.

72
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,600
It is also like this when a person who developed faith and vows

73
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,600
and recited the Buddha name is about to die,

74
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,600
and Amitabha and his assembly of saints appear before that person.

75
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,600
It is also like this when the person dies

76
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,600
without his or her mind falling into delusion,

77
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:50,600
and the person is immediately born in Amitabha's land of ultimate bliss.

78
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,600
It talks about four important passages.

79
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,600
If you want to see the Buddha land that is a hundred billion lands away,

80
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:04,600
your mind has to be like the unmoved mirror back to our true nature.

81
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Then you will see the pure land.

82
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,600
And if you want to see the Amitabha who is expanding the Dharma right now,

83
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:18,600
it is also not apart from this unmoved mirror that is our true nature.

84
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,600
When we are about to die,

85
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,600
Amitabha and his assembly appear before us.

86
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,600
It is also not away from our true mind.

87
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,600
And when we do not fall into delusion,

88
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,600
when we die because our mind is unified and not chaotic,

89
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,600
chanting the name Amitabha,

90
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,600
it is also not apart from this true mind.

91
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,600
All these important factors of rebirth all depend on us

92
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,600
residing in our true suchness like this perfect clear mirror.

93
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,600
In conclusion,

94
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,600
we must recognize that every word in the Sutra

95
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:04,600
is reflected in the great perfect mirror wisdom of the Ocean Seal Samadhi.

96
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,600
When our eighth consciousness, the deluded mind,

97
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,600
is completely purified,

98
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,600
it is called the great perfect mirror wisdom.

99
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,600
We are now perfectly pure without any delusion

100
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,600
and attachment to the illusory images inside the mirror.

101
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,600
That means all the circumstances that's happening to us right now,

102
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,600
we know that's illusion.

103
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,600
And we're back to the clarity of our mind.

104
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,600
That's the perfect mirror wisdom.

105
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,600
And it's also like the calm ocean

106
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,600
that doesn't have any waves of ignorance.

107
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,600
The surface will reflect everything clearly.

108
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:49,600
So everything is dependent on us being aligned with our true nature.

109
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,600
That is the secret of rebirth

110
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,600
and also the secret of enlightenment.

111
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,600
The power of our mind is really the determined factor.

112
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,600
I would like to share a little story.

113
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,600
There was a little girl from two to seven.

114
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,600
She had this rash on her face and body.

115
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,600
It was really discomforting.

116
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,600
All the dermatologists told her,

117
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,600
there's nothing you can do.

118
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,600
You will just grow out of it when you get older.

119
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,600
When she was seven, she went to a holistic doctor.

120
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,600
And this doctor told her,

121
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,600
you will actually grow out of it when you get older.

122
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,600
But if you can talk to these bumps yourself

123
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,600
and ask them nicely to go away,

124
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,600
they will actually disappear.

125
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,600
The little girl really believed in it.

126
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,600
That same night, she hid herself in the blanket

127
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,600
and started talking sincerely to the bumps on her face.

128
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,600
That was on a Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday.

129
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,600
She did the same thing.

130
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,600
By Friday, all the rashes were gone.

131
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
There was no more.

132
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,600
And it never ever happened again.

133
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,600
Why?

134
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,600
Because she really had faith

135
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,600
and she really wanted it to happen.

136
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,600
She had vowed and she really talked to them.

137
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
She really prayed.

138
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,600
She really practiced as if they are alive

139
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,600
and it really will work.

140
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,600
So when we have faith, vow, and practice,

141
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,600
there's nothing we cannot do.

142
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,600
The secret is all within the power of our mind.

143
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,600
There's nothing we cannot accomplish.

144
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,600
So that's the class for today.

145
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,600
Thank you for listening.

146
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,600
Amitabha.
