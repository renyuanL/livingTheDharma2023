1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,360
Today we are going to talk about cultivation.

2
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:22,040
Now we know we have the inherent enlightened mind, how do we bring it out?

3
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,360
We need to cultivate.

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:29,960
Cultivation is putting Buddha's teaching into practice on a continued and regular basis.

5
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:36,660
Masters often say, when cultivation has merit, the inherent will surface.

6
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,060
So according to the Tiantai sect of Buddhism, there are five ways to cultivate in order

7
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,360
to bring out our inherent enlightened mind.

8
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,360
Let's look at the five practices.

9
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,560
One, joy from according with the truth.

10
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,720
There are three things to do here.

11
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:58,420
One is to hear of the truth, two is to accord with the truth, and three is to be joyful.

12
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,920
Now let's look at what is the truth.

13
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:06,620
We have the one true mind, or we call it the single vehicle of Buddha's teaching.

14
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:12,300
It's the perfect teaching which tells us that we have the Buddha nature, the true mind,

15
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,200
or the suchness that's the same as all enlightened Buddha.

16
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,860
So in the Lotus Sutra, it gives a wonderful example.

17
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,620
This Buddha nature is a balance of the void and the unreal.

18
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,240
So it's called the mean or the middle way.

19
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,700
We need to enter the chamber of Tathagata, which is great compassion.

20
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,560
So the room of Buddha, that Buddha dwells in, is great compassion.

21
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,060
That is our middle way.

22
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,460
We need to wear the garment of Tathagata, which is gentleness and perseverance.

23
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:50,700
We naturally, wearing the clothes of gentleness and perseverance, we don't have any anger

24
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,620
in our Buddha nature.

25
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,940
And we need to sit in the seat of Tathagata, which is emptiness.

26
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,940
We need to sit in the seat of Tathagata, which is emptiness.

27
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:03,260
Dwell in the wisdom of emptiness, so that we will not be attached to worldly things.

28
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:07,060
So this is our true nature, that is called the inner truth.

29
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:13,040
We need to accord ourselves with this inner truth all the time, like tuning to the right

30
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,220
station of the radio, or typing the right address, so we get into the right website.

31
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:23,260
So align and accord ourselves with this inner truth.

32
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,400
Lastly, we need to be very joyful.

33
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,400
We need to be in a hysterical state.

34
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,640
We need to be in a state of happiness, to be dwelling in our inner essence.

35
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,100
And now we need to do five sub-practices.

36
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:39,320
Number one, repentance in principle and practice.

37
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,760
Repentance is changing the past and cultivating for the future.

38
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,160
So in principle, we don't really have any negative karma to repent.

39
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:54,000
We have to just be with our Buddha nature, be with our sessionist, and there's nothing

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
to repent.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But in practice, we have to be with our Buddha nature, and there's nothing to repent.

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,100
In practice, our six organs are always seeking external stimulation that is already creating

43
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,100
negative karma for us.

44
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:10,940
Anytime and anywhere, we need to repent because we're always seeking outside.

45
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,820
Number two, we need to be imploring.

46
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:18,600
We want to request the Buddha to remain in this world.

47
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,440
Just like if there's no student who wants to learn, then the teacher will not stay to

48
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,440
teach.

49
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,840
So Buddha is the teacher.

50
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,720
We need to sincerely want to cultivate, then we will have the dharma in this world.

51
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:37,460
So Buddha's teaching and wisdom is like a torch of light illuminating the world.

52
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:42,000
Without the dharma, without Buddha, this world will forever be in darkness.

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,440
So request the Buddha to remain in this world by our own cultivation.

54
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,940
Number three is rejoicing, to rejoice and congratulate and respect everyone's Buddha

55
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,940
nature.

56
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,720
We don't judge different schools of Buddhism or any other practices because everyone has

57
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,460
the same Buddha nature as us.

58
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:10,360
When someone is aligned with their inner truth, they will never feel envy or jealous toward

59
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,360
anyone.

60
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,220
They will always be rejoicing for other people's success and their practices.

61
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,220
Merit transference.

62
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:22,720
Every time we do any kind of merit or chant Buddha's name or do any kind of meditation

63
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,940
or do good deeds.

64
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,120
We want to dedicate this merit to all sentient beings.

65
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,920
We don't want to hack it up all for ourselves.

66
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,320
We want to give it to everybody else.

67
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,620
That way they will have good merits and they will be able to reduce their negative karmas.

68
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,020
A Bodhisattva always transferring merit to everyone.

69
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:48,460
When you transfer the merit, a little good kind deed will multiply into a big huge merit.

70
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:53,460
The magnitude of your transference is depending on how aligned you are with the Buddha.

71
00:04:53,460 --> 00:05:03,460
To make vows, we want to make four great vows to save all sentient beings and all our afflictions.

72
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,460
To learn all the Dharma doors and we want to attain Buddhahood.

73
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:13,920
We constantly have to have these vows to motivate us to keep going, keep practicing and never

74
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,100
retrogress.

75
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:20,240
So bring the vows back to your inner self to contemplate your inner truth.

76
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,640
Every one of your thoughts is a sentient being.

77
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,640
That means you are a Buddha.

78
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,440
That means you are a Buddha.

79
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,760
If you want to attain Buddhahood, you need to be saved.

80
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,260
We don't have any afflictions in our true Buddha nature.

81
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:32,720
Go back to your inner self and know that you don't have any afflictions.

82
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,960
And learn all the Dharma doors, all the wisdom and all Dharma's teaching are already in our

83
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,960
pure mind.

84
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,240
So we actually don't need to learn so much, you just have to dwell in your inner true

85
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,960
being.

86
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,220
And then you want to attain Buddhahood.

87
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:52,940
We already have the Buddha nature within us, so always bring your vows inward to your own

88
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,440
sense.

89
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:59,960
That's the five practices that will bring us joy from according with the truth.

90
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:06,680
So all this is doing is bringing out a single thought of willing acceptance of the inner

91
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,680
truth.

92
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:14,280
We just need this one single thought, one moment that you have this full willing acceptance

93
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,280
of the truth.

94
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:22,080
Every moment you are just wanting to align yourself with that one thought of total acceptance

95
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,380
of who you really are, your true self is omniscient, it's like a Buddha.

96
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:34,320
For example, if you have a boss that's always reprimanding you, at that moment he is yelling

97
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:40,580
at you, you have to bring yourself to this one single thought of willing acceptance.

98
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:45,080
You have to say to yourself, I have the Buddha nature within me.

99
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,080
I need to sit in the sea of emptiness.

100
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,080
My boss' harsh words are not real.

101
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,080
They are just attention.

102
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,080
They are temporary existence.

103
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:59,840
It's nothing for me to worry about and wear the garment of gentleness and perseverance.

104
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,420
I don't have an ounce of anger in me.

105
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,420
I'm always gentle and have perseverance.

106
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:10,380
So let go of all the anger, dwell in the chamber of great compassion.

107
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:16,220
My true mind, I have great compassion toward all beings, including my boss.

108
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:22,080
So when you are at this moment, one single thought of willing acceptance of your inner

109
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,720
being, then you are back to your self nature.

110
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,080
You are enlightened for that moment.

111
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:34,140
So practicing moment to moment, just like when we chant Amitabha Buddha's name, if we

112
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:39,640
accord with our inner inherent mind, we are Buddha for that moment.

113
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:45,740
And if moment to moment, we are dwelling in our inherent enlightened mind, we are Amitabha

114
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,960
Buddha moment to moment.

115
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,080
So that's how we practice from moment to moment.

116
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,080
2.

117
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,400
We need to read and recite the Mahayana Sutra, especially the Lotus Sutra.

118
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:05,200
Just by reading the Lotus Sutra, it's incredible merit because you are preserving the Dharma

119
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:11,280
of the single vehicle, like holding the Tathagata in respect on your head.

120
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,720
You are putting Buddha on your head.

121
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,440
That's how magnificent it is just to read the Dharma.

122
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,080
When we are reading, we are silencing our mind, following the words.

123
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:29,300
That is called the literary prajna, really tap into our inner truth, our true suchness.

124
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:35,200
Chanting and reciting is a very good habit to do it on a regular basis.

125
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,960
The Lotus Sutra has 28 chapters.

126
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:43,960
You can do one chapter a day for 30 days or half a year, or you can do different chapters

127
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,960
every day.

128
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,400
It's up to you how you want to read the Sutra, but you want to do it on a regular basis.

129
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,400
That was a big lesson.

130
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,600
There was a practitioner in the Song Dynasty.

131
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,720
He always said, life is just like someone who's traveling for a hundred years.

132
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,720
What is there to be contentious about?

133
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,380
He's very carefree.

134
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:07,220
He just reads the Lotus Sutra and Chant Amitabha Buddha's name every day.

135
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:13,960
And one day the universal worthy Bodhisattva appeared riding a six tusk white elephant

136
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:20,400
and spoke to him, Mr. Fan Yan, because you read the Lotus Sutra and Chant Amitabha Buddha's

137
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,640
name every day, soon you shall go to the Pure Land.

138
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:30,280
The next day he sat on a chair with his palms joined together.

139
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,900
He Chant Buddha's name and went to the Pure Land.

140
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:40,340
So by reading the Lotus Sutra, it's like osmosis of our true suchness.

141
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,080
So it's a great practice.

142
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,620
Number three is teaching the Dharma.

143
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,600
Not only do we have to read, we have to teach it to others.

144
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,600
You don't have to be a monk to do it.

145
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,600
You don't have to be a monk to do it.

146
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,780
You don't have to be a monk to teach the Dharma.

147
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:56,020
You just have to let people know about this single truth.

148
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:01,000
All you have to say is, did you know that your true mind is the same as Amitabha's true

149
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
mind?

150
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,280
Just one mind and there's no difference at all.

151
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,280
That's all you have to say.

152
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,800
That will help others to know, oh, I'm the same as Amitabha.

153
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,580
It will give people faith and to know what is real chanting, what is real enlightenment.

154
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,580
And you know, teaching the Dharma really help us conform to the Dharma.

155
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,580
You know, we have to be wise, we have to be good in our own way.

156
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,580
We have to be wise in our own way.

157
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,580
We have to be wise in our own way.

158
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,580
But we also have to be able to perform our own understanding as well.

159
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:27,180
We want to teach the Dharma in accordance with the questioner's capacity.

160
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,660
Everybody's understanding and capabilities are different.

161
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,900
So you want to teach accordingly.

162
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,280
Tailor your answers toward everybody's differences.

163
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:40,320
You use illustrations or examples and stories to make them understand.

164
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,380
You don't expound the Dharma, just what you want to say.

165
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,860
You only say things to make them really understand and to feel joy in their heart by asking the

166
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,860
Dharma.

167
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,860
That's all you have to say.

168
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,860
Number four is learning.

169
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:56,580
heart by understanding. Number four is practicing the six pyramidas simultaneously. So our main

170
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:03,460
practice is still contemplating on our true suchness. That's our main practice all the time.

171
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:09,400
So that's your major. But now you have a minor. You want to practice the six pyramidas to help

172
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:16,280
others. We want to be giving, have whole precepts, have endurance, have diligence, concentration,

173
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:23,280
and wisdom. If you're aligned with your true suchness, your pure mind, you will realize that

174
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:31,360
giving is natural because there is no greediness whatsoever in your true mind. And holding precepts

175
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:37,880
would be simple because in your true mind is incapable of breaking the precepts. Endurance is

176
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:45,080
easy because in your Buddha nature, there's not an ounce of anger in you. Diligence is usual because

177
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,260
you don't have an ounce of anger in you. And you don't have an ounce of anger in you. And you

178
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:51,800
don't have an ounce of laziness in you. Concentration is effortless because your true mind is always

179
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:58,980
focused and never scattered. And your wisdom is natural. Without any ignorance, you're perfectly

180
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:05,520
enlightened and have great wisdom. So when you're aligned with your true mind, your pure suchness,

181
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:12,740
you can practice the six pyramidas naturally. Number five, correctly practicing the six

182
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,160
pyramidas. Now you can double major because

183
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,240
you can practice the six pyramidas naturally. Number five, correctly practicing the six

184
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:23,520
your contemplation of your inner truth is now very mature you're able to help others and do the six

185
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:30,480
pyramidas correctly now that your self-cultivation and teaching of others both totally fulfilled

186
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:39,100
in principle and practice your true mind is unhindered you're able to control all your

187
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:45,360
delusions we have five delusions according to the tian tai teaching the first one is delusion

188
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:52,420
of view the second one is delusion of thought in the world of desire the third one is also

189
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:59,800
the delusion of thought but in the world of form fourth one is also the delusion of thought in the

190
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:07,160
world of formless and the last one is the delusion of ignorance so now you're able to control all

191
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:15,160
five delusions because of your practice this is called the five preliminary stages of disciples

192
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:15,340
you're able to control all five delusions because of your practice this is called the

193
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:15,360
five preliminary stages of disciples the sixth one is the delusion of thought but in the world of form as

194
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:22,360
After this stage, we become true Bodhisattva entering the 52 stages of Buddhahood.

195
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,360
So that's the class for today. Thank you for listening. Amitabha.
