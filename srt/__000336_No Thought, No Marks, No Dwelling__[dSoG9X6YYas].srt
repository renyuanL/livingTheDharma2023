00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,100
Today we are going to talk about No Thought, No Mark, and No Dwelling.

2
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:26,400
This is from the Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch of Zen Buddhism, Master Huineng.

3
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,400
He said this is the three pillars of Zen Buddhism.

4
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,400
No thought is the doctrine of Zen Buddhism.

5
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,900
No mark is the substance of Zen Buddhism.

6
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,900
And no dwelling is the basis of Zen Buddhism.

7
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,900
Let's first look at no thought.

8
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,400
What does it mean by no thought?

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,900
It is to be without thought while in the midst of thought.

10
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:55,900
No means no two marks, no thought of defilement.

11
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:01,900
Thought means thought of the original nature of true suchness.

12
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,900
So to be without thought while in the midst of thought.

13
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,900
We cannot be without thoughts, but we should have the state of no thought.

14
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:23,900
No means no two marks, which means no duality of good and bad, large or small, pure or impure.

15
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,900
We all think in terms of dualism.

16
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,900
That means we are labeling and we are judging.

17
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:38,900
So no thought means no judging, no labeling, and no thought of defilement.

18
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:43,900
All dualism is considered defilement.

19
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,900
Our natural state of mind should be without defilement.

20
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:52,900
Thought means thought of the original nature of true suchness.

21
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:59,900
The real thought means when we are aligned with our true suchness.

22
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,900
That's our Buddha nature.

23
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:09,900
When we are aligned with our Buddha nature, our thought should be no thought.

24
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,900
What is the state of no thought?

25
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:19,900
It's quiescent, which is still and not moved, yet it's shining with awareness.

26
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,900
Shining with awareness.

27
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,900
Yet ever quiescent.

28
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,900
We usually use the metaphor of a mirror.

29
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,900
The mirror itself is quiescent.

30
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,900
It doesn't move.

31
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,900
It doesn't react to the images.

32
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:42,900
But it's aware, which means it can reflect all the images clearly.

33
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:48,900
Our mind should be in this state, like the perfect mirror.

34
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,900
That's the state of no thought.

35
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,900
No thought doesn't mean we get rid of all thoughts.

36
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,900
Master Hui Nan said if we get rid of all thoughts,

37
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,900
even at the time of our death, we have no thought,

38
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,900
we still keep reincarnating.

39
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,900
We think to be completely without thought is no thought.

40
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,900
Then you misunderstood the Dharma.

41
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:18,900
And if you pass it down to others, that is blandering the Dharma.

42
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,900
So do not think it's completely without thoughts.

43
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:27,900
It is just being quiescent and shining with awareness.

44
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:33,900
Master Hui Nan, he was a poor, illiterate lumberjack.

45
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:40,900
When the fifth patriarch, Hong Ren, passed him the robe and the bowl,

46
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,900
which means passing down the lineage of Zen Buddhism,

47
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,900
everyone was jealous and upset with him.

48
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,900
So he had to run away and hide.

49
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:56,900
The first person that caught up to him was a monk named Hui Ming.

50
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:02,900
He was a general of the fourth rank when he was a layman.

51
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,900
So he's very strong, very powerful.

52
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,900
Once he caught up to the master,

53
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,900
the master put the robe and the bowl on the rock

54
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,900
and hid himself in the bushes.

55
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,900
Hui Ming immediately tried to take the robe and the bowl.

56
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,900
But for the life of him, he could not move them.

57
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,900
He knew something was mysterious.

58
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,900
Being a practitioner, he immediately changed his attitude.

59
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,900
He said,

60
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,900
I came here for the Dharma, not for the robe.

61
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,900
That's when the master came out of the bushes.

62
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,900
He said,

63
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,900
If you really came for the Dharma,

64
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,900
you should refrain from thinking of anything

65
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,900
and keep your mind blank.

66
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,900
Then I will teach you.

67
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,900
So they sat in silence for a long while.

68
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,900
Finally, the master said,

69
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,900
When you are thinking of neither good or evil,

70
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:13,900
what is at that particular moment is your real nature.

71
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,900
As soon as Hui Ming heard this,

72
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,900
he at once became enlightened.

73
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:25,900
So we should keep our mind at the state of no thought,

74
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,900
no dualism of good or evil.

75
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,900
That is the true state of mind that we should be at.

76
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:39,900
That's when we are aligning ourselves with our true suchness.

77
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,900
Now let's look at no mark.

78
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:48,900
No mark means to be apart from marks while in the midst of marks.

79
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,900
Mark means phenomenon or forms.

80
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:58,900
Everything we see in the world is considered a mark.

81
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,900
So we have all these existences in the world,

82
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,900
but we are detached from them.

83
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,900
We see everything, we hear everything,

84
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,900
but we are not attached to them.

85
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:18,900
The ability to be separate from marks is the purity of the Dharma substance.

86
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:24,900
We should have the ability to detach ourselves from all the phenomenon.

87
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,900
That is when our mind is pure,

88
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,900
our Dharma substance, which is our true suchness,

89
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,900
it will surface.

90
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,900
So only when your mind doesn't have defiled thought,

91
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,900
no judgment of the outside phenomenon,

92
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,900
that's when we are aligning ourselves with our real nature.

93
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,900
That is enlightenment.

94
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,900
That is prajna.

95
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,900
In the Diamond Sutra,

96
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:55,900
it teaches us to be away from four forms.

97
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,900
The form of the self,

98
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,900
form of others,

99
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,900
form of people,

100
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,900
form of life span.

101
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,900
Therefore we should not have the idea of the self.

102
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,900
The form of a self,

103
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:14,900
form of another who is separate from us,

104
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,900
form of everyone else,

105
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,900
all the beings in the world,

106
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,900
and form of time.

107
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,900
So time and state,

108
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,900
self and other,

109
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,900
these are all phenomenon.

110
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:32,900
All phenomenon are just illusions created by our mind.

111
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,900
So detach from the form.

112
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,900
Though they have conditioned existence right now,

113
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,900
but be detached,

114
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:46,900
that means our mind doesn't have afflictions or emotions

115
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,900
based on the external world.

116
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,900
So that means no mark.

117
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,900
That's the substance of Zen Buddhism.

118
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,900
Lastly, no dwelling.

119
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,900
In every thought,

120
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,900
do not think of former states.

121
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,900
We should not let our thought keep continuing

122
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,900
from one thought

123
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,900
to another.

124
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,900
When we have succeeding thoughts

125
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,900
after thought without interruption,

126
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,900
that is bondage.

127
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,900
That is why we are reincarnating.

128
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,900
Reincarnation doesn't just mean

129
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,900
lifetime and lifetime of rebirth.

130
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,900
It means in our mind,

131
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,900
our thought keep going

132
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,900
and going in a vicious cycle.

133
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,900
This cycle is reincarnation.

134
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,900
So if we want to be reincarnated,

135
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,900
we have to be free from reincarnation.

136
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,900
We have to learn

137
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,900
so our mind does not dwell

138
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,900
in thought after thought.

139
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,900
Master Hui Nan says,

140
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,900
in the world of good and evil,

141
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,900
attractiveness and ugliness,

142
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,900
friendliness and hostility,

143
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,900
when you are faced with language

144
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,900
which is offensive, critical and argumentative,

145
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,900
you should treat it all as empty

146
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,900
and have no thought of revenge.

147
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,900
So in all worldly experience of duality,

148
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,900
do not have defiled thoughts.

149
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,900
That is called no dwelling.

150
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,900
Not to dwell in dharmas

151
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,900
from thought to thought

152
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,900
is to be free from bondage.

153
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,900
Free from the bondage of our mind.

154
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,900
The fourth patriarch of Zen Buddhism,

155
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,900
his name is Daoxin.

156
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,900
He became a monk

157
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,900
when he was only seven years old.

158
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,900
When he was fourteen,

159
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,900
he went to visit the third patriarch,

160
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,900
Sen Can.

161
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,900
When he arrived,

162
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,900
he asked the master,

163
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,900
Master, please teach me

164
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,900
the dharma of liberation.

165
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,900
The master asked him,

166
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,900
Who tied you up?

167
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,900
The young monk thought about it

168
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,900
for a long time and answered,

169
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,900
No one.

170
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,900
Then the master said,

171
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,900
If no one is tying you up,

172
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,900
why do you need the dharma of liberation?

173
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,900
As soon as he heard this,

174
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,900
he at once became enlightened.

175
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,900
So who is tying you up?

176
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,900
It's not the people around you.

177
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,900
It's not your situation.

178
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,900
It's only your attachment

179
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,900
to your own thought.

180
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,900
That is reincarnation.

181
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,900
So enlightenment means

182
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,900
we do not dwell

183
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,900
in our thought after thought.

184
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,900
In conclusion,

185
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,900
if one is well able

186
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,900
to discriminate all dharma marks,

187
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,900
then in the primary meanings,

188
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,900
one does not move.

189
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,900
This is from the Mimalakirti Sutra.

190
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,900
If we are well able

191
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,900
to discriminate

192
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,900
all the phenomena of the world,

193
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,900
we can see,

194
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,900
we can hear,

195
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,900
we can feel,

196
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,900
we can know

197
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,900
everything clearly.

198
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,900
But we do not move

199
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,900
because we dwell in the primary meaning,

200
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,900
which is the true suchness.

201
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,900
Therefore our mind

202
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,900
should not be moved

203
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,900
by all the phenomena in the world.

204
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,900
That's when we have

205
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,900
real liberation.

206
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,900
So Zen Buddhism

207
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,900
is to teach us

208
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,900
in our prajna,

209
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,900
samadhi,

210
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,900
we should have

211
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,900
no thought,

212
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,900
no mark,

213
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,900
and no dwelling.

214
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,900
That should be

215
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,900
our natural state of mind.

216
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,900
That's when our mind

217
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,900
is aligned

218
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,900
with our Buddha nature.

219
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,900
So that's the class for today.

220
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,900
Thank you for listening.

221
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,900
Amitabha.

222
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,900
