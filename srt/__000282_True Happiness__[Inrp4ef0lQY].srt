1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,400
Today we are going to talk about true happiness.

2
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,000
Buddha is an enlightened being who has the power of meditative absorption and perfect

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
wisdom.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,680
That is the source of our true happiness.

5
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:33,240
In this class, we will use the great wisdom shastra to taste the flavor of this true happiness.

6
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,040
Relaxedly meditate under a tree in the forest.

7
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,040
We don't need much to be happy.

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:45,300
We just need to sit in a quiet place and just enjoy our breathing and be present.

9
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,800
That's all we need to be happy and content.

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,700
With tranquility and rapture, all evil cease.

11
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:59,400
The two signs of deep meditation are tranquility and rapture.

12
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:04,700
Tranquility is the calmness, the peace of our mind, and the rapture is the unconditional

13
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:09,220
happiness of just being alive and breathing.

14
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,420
When we have this, all evil cease.

15
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:19,660
Evil actually means the two major hindrances, which are dowsiness and restlessness.

16
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,220
When we have tranquility, we definitely rest.

17
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,220
When we have tranquility, we definitely rest.

18
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,140
When we have rapture, we definitely don't have any restlessness.

19
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,500
Our mind is definitely calm and not chaotic and full of wandering thoughts.

20
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:37,680
When we have rapture, our mind is not drowsy because it's very happy and alive and alert.

21
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,980
So all evil ceases.

22
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,960
The mind enters a spiritual unity.

23
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,920
When we have deep concentration, we will be united with our one true mind, our Buddha nature.

24
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,920
The easiest way to reach this is through meditation.

25
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,920
When we have deep concentration, we will be united with our one true mind, our Buddha nature.

26
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,920
The easiest way to reach this is through meditation.

27
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,040
When we have deep concentration, we will be united with our one true mind, our Buddha nature.

28
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,740
To reach this spiritual unity, is actually to recite Amitabha Buddha life while meditating.

29
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,740
When we have deep concentration, we will be united with our one true mind, our Buddha nature.

30
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,740
The easiest way to reach this is through meditation.

31
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,740
The easiest way to reach this is through meditation.

32
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,880
The easiest way to reach this is through meditation.

33
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,080
The easiest way to reach this is through meditation.

34
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,060
This name actually means infinite light and infinite life.

35
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:10,580
Infinite life means infinite wisdom, and infinite life means infinite married and virtue.

36
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:16,600
This name itself is the spiritual unity of our one true mind.

37
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:16,680
By this time we no longer think of any goodness or evil.

38
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,440
This name itself is the spiritual unity of our one true mind.

39
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,220
By this time we no longer think of any goodness or evil without gerwalking toavin woman.

40
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:27,100
think of any goodness or evil there's no more duality of merit or offenses and there's no form

41
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:35,020
no name it's just the one true mind so when we reach this spiritual unity the joy exceeds

42
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:42,540
heavenly joy the heavenly beings in the 28 levels of heaven they still have affliction they still

43
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:49,740
have an ego and they haven't reached their one true mind their spiritual unity so our happiness

44
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:57,100
of meditating and being awakened is much more than the happiness of the heavens now let's look at

45
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:04,460
what we ordinary people think of happiness ordinary people pursue worldly goods mundane

46
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:11,020
people think the source of our happiness is acquiring possessions we think possessing

47
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,500
material goods, we think we buy and sell natural goods, we think we precious and practice other

48
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:12,520
We think we possess material goods and we practice other pleasure and patrol is non- sick, leverage,

49
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:20,140
will make us happy. The examples used here are branding clothing or fashion bed linings.

50
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:28,940
This actually includes everything. Cars, watches, bags, or a cell phone, houses. These are things

51
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:35,040
that we pursue. We think it will make us happy. That's why we keep seeking it. But we don't

52
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,900
realize that this happiness we're pursuing actually has two main faults. One, this sort

53
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:49,840
of happiness is never stable. This happiness is only temporary and short lived. Because

54
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,120
the thing you love, it might be stolen. Someone else has a better one and then you're no

55
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:03,100
longer happy or they would get old and break. The second fault is never satisfied when pursuing

56
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:10,560
material good. The desire is insatiable. No one says oh I have enough money or I have

57
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,560
enough goods.

58
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:11,880
I don't want anything else to break my Esquire. I don't want a swooping Здесьaction county.

59
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:19,720
need anymore everybody keep pursuing and wanting more and never satisfied when you are not content

60
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:26,280
you will never be happy this happiness has a lot of problems and this is what's causing

61
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:33,800
our samsara to keep going once upon a time there was a master named jim b finn he was great at

62
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:40,760
meditation he can always go into deep concentration his body would disappear and nobody can find him

63
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:47,480
one day his life was about to end king yama the lord of hell summoned the two ghost manians

64
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:53,240
to catch him when they got there they couldn't find him so they asked the earth deity the earth

65
00:04:53,240 --> 00:05:00,200
deity said oh he always going to deep meditation and nobody can find him but he has a favorite

66
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:07,160
precious elms bowl if you can find it and tap on it three times he will exit from his meditation

67
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,280
the dwarves found it and did us instructed

68
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:10,740
sure

69
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:15,600
After enough, Jing Bi Feng awoke from his meditation and was caught by the ghost.

70
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:22,140
Jing Bi Feng silently lamented on how his attachment to the Anus bowl was the reason

71
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:27,080
why he was still unable to be liberated from Samsara.

72
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:33,780
Swiftly he threw the bowl on the ground, shattering it into pieces, sat down to meditate, went

73
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,500
into deep concentration, and escaped for good.

74
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,660
So what is your precious Anus bowl?

75
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:47,760
It can be material good, it can be the people you love, it can be your talent, your career.

76
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:54,940
If you are attached to anything that is preventing us from liberation, especially for Pure Land

77
00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:00,760
Buddhas, if we still have an Anus of attachment, that will prevent us from going to the Western

78
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,760
Pure Land.

79
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,020
So let go of our attachment to worldly goods.

80
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:10,320
Above we are talking about concentration, now we are going to talk about wisdom.

81
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,320
We are going to talk about Samahati.

82
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,320
We stay at a quiet, remote place.

83
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:21,820
Samahati is the robe that monastics wear to symbolize their renunciation of the world.

84
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:26,280
And we stay in a quiet, remote place to meditate.

85
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,460
All we try to do is to have spiritual awakening.

86
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,820
Train the mind to be stable in action or non-action.

87
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:39,220
When we are sitting in meditation, it's called non-action.

88
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,220
We are non-active.

89
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,220
We are not moving.

90
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,220
We are just sitting there.

91
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:49,200
We are just deep into our mind and into our breathing and into the NAMI DAPA.

92
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,720
So it's easy for the mind to be stable when we are sitting.

93
00:06:53,720 --> 00:07:00,560
But when we are in action in our daily lives, it is harder for our mind to be stable.

94
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:08,220
So we need to train our mind to be stable in six daily actions of walking, standing,

95
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,220
sitting, lying down.

96
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,560
Lying down, working, and speaking.

97
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,340
We should observe all our actions and all our thoughts.

98
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,560
For example, walking.

99
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,200
One should observe the intention arise from the mind wanting to walk.

100
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,580
The body moves forward accordingly.

101
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:35,320
The movement of the body might be accompanied by mental formation such as good or evil thoughts

102
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,320
from within.

103
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,720
We might be walking to hit someone.

104
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,720
Or walking to help someone.

105
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,220
That are good or evil intentions.

106
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:50,220
As such, one should raise awareness, see through the intention of walking, understand that

107
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,220
this intention has no form.

108
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:57,520
There is not a self as the walker or the perception of walking.

109
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:03,780
Both are empty of an intrinsic nature that is true insight meditation.

110
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:08,060
So the insight can light up the mind to see through the reality.

111
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:16,180
When we have this insight, it will illuminate our mind and we will see the truth about

112
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,940
everything which is emptiness.

113
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:24,820
Nothing is as real and permanent and independent as we think.

114
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,640
So when we see emptiness, then we are liberated.

115
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:36,780
When the mind can investigate various dharmas with equal insight, always observe everything

116
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,860
in this manner.

117
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:45,420
Use the equal insight, empty of the self, empty of all dharma, that is called equal

118
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,420
insight.

119
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:53,300
When we have this emptiness wisdom, then we will no longer be caught up by anything.

120
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:58,780
Your mind will not be moved by external situations and factors.

121
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:05,060
You will always be in deep meditation and deep wisdom, arising wisdom to overcome delusions.

122
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,060
With this insight, we will overcome delusions.

123
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,060
With this insight, we will overcome delusions.

124
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,060
With this insight, we will overcome delusions.

125
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:14,220
We will overcome all our delusions because there is actually no delusion.

126
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,540
We understand the emptiness of our delusions.

127
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:21,580
There's no real anger, there is no real greed.

128
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:27,220
When you understand they are just conditions of existence, you will no longer be capable

129
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:31,720
of anger or greed because they are not the real you.

130
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:37,220
You no longer are attached to this personality and all of these afflictions.

131
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:37,960
An inner spirit will no longer be in touch with you.

132
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:44,060
all these afflictions now disappears. This happiness surpasses the three rounds. When

133
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:51,340
we have this wisdom, this happiness will take us beyond samsara, which is the three rounds.

134
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:57,400
There's no more the round of desire, the round of form, and the round of formlessness.

135
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:05,240
We go beyond reincarnation and samsara. So all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, they practice

136
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:15,080
meditation because they know that deep meditation and wisdom is true happiness. And for a Bodhisattva,

137
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:20,840
if you really want to help sentient beings, the only way is when you have deep meditative

138
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:27,600
absorption, all your prayers and your vows will really come to fruition and other people

139
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:34,840
can really benefit from your prayer. So this is the kind of happiness that we will experience

140
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,200
when we practice meditation.

141
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,860
We go to the Western Pure Land. Right now, we might experience it for a short moment

142
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:46,200
of time, but over there, you will experience it every day and constantly. You will have

143
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:52,800
deep concentration and deep wisdom. So let's practice right now with all our power. Then

144
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,000
we'll definitely be going to the Western Pure Land and reaching enlightenment.

145
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So that's the class for today. Thank you for listening. Hope everybody have true happiness.

146
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Amitabha.

147
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,000
Amitabha.
