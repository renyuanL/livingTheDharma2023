00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,800
Today we are going to talk about

2
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,240
Liao Fan's fourth lesson, the fourth lesson.

3
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:38,080
The fourth lesson is the benefits of the virtue of humility.

4
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,920
You want to change your destiny, change all your bad ways and do all that is good, but

5
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,440
you want to keep your virtues, you have to stay humble.

6
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,960
Humbleness is a virtue.

7
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,240
If you can stay humble, you will keep your prosperity and your good fortune.

8
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:59,560
This lesson, we're going to learn how to be humble based on what Liao Fan's experienced.

9
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:05,960
In the book of I Ching, he actually told us a lot of goodness of being humble.

10
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,760
The laws of heaven take from the arrogant and benefit the humble.

11
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,940
The heaven likes people that are humble.

12
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:20,080
They take away from the people that are arrogant and give to people that are humble.

13
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:26,860
So we want to stay down to earth and respectful and not to boast about ourselves or accomplishment

14
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,760
or anything that we have.

15
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,900
And we want to be humble.

16
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,900
That's the first step.

17
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:32,900
The second step is the law of the earth.

18
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,300
The law of the earth is that the earth brings flowing water from the areas that are full

19
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,200
to those that are lower as it passes by.

20
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,980
When you're too high, that means the water is full.

21
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:47,580
The earth always brings the water down to the people that are humble.

22
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,140
That means at lower places.

23
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,160
The earth will benefit you and bring the water to you because you are being humble.

24
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,160
So that's the third.

25
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,160
The third is the law of spirits bringing water to you.

26
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,160
That's the third.

27
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,160
That's the third.

28
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:04,880
bring harm to those who are arrogant and good fortune to those who are modest so

29
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,740
that the heavenly beings the spirits they actually can see our heart and see

30
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:15,400
our every action if you're arrogant they actually will hurt you you have bad luck

31
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,660
the bad thing will happen to you for no reason but if you stay humble and modest

32
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:25,400
you will get a lot of good fortune from the spirits spirit will help you out

33
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:31,480
because you've been very modest and lastly the loss of people despise those

34
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:38,640
who are arrogant and prefer those who are modest even in our world people

35
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,400
don't like to hang out with people that are very arrogant

36
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,980
you're always bragging about yourself nobody wants to be your friend because

37
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:50,520
you're so fool of yourself even the loss of people despite those who are arrogant

38
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,480
and prefer those who are mining so the Heaven

39
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,400
the Earth

40
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:03,720
the spirit people they all prefer people that are humble and don't like those that are very arrogant

41
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:13,720
their arrogance invites disaster humility gains benefit if you're arrogant you invite trouble for

42
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:20,840
yourself okay if you're humble then you gain a lot of good things good thing will happen to you

43
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,760
naturally okay so liao fan now tells about a couple of his friends at his time there was a

44
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:34,440
person named jing yu ding he went to take the imperial exam with liao fan so there were 10

45
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:40,200
of them all went to take the test out of the 10 of them they're the youngest who is jing yu he's

46
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:46,520
the only one that's very modest when people insult him slander him he doesn't talk back

47
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,760
he just accepts whatever the accusation liao fan said this person

48
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,680
would be the only person that will pass the test and sure enough out of that 10 jing yu was the only

49
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:03,560
one who passed the test that year then the second person liao fan's childhood friend kai zi feng now

50
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:10,040
they're older liao fan said when kai zi was young he was very very arrogant but now he's grown up

51
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:17,240
he's actually become very mild and humble and respectful one of his friends always like to

52
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,520
accuse him and scold him of all his mistakes

53
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:20,760
but

54
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:28,280
he never talks back he just calmly accepts all the accusations and never says anything so liao

55
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:34,200
fan said he will be the person that will pass the test and sure enough kai zi passed the test that

56
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:39,800
year there was a third person he passed the preliminary test when he was very young but

57
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:45,400
for the life of him he couldn't pass the second level he wrote very good essay but he still

58
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:50,760
couldn't pass and one year his dad went to a different province to take a government

59
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:57,400
post so he went with his dad over there there's a very famous scholar so he brought his essay to

60
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:03,800
show the scholar the scholar actually destroyed made a lot of correction on his essay he

61
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:12,440
respectfully accepts all the correction and he made all the changes and sure enough that year he

62
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:18,200
passed the exam not the imperial exam okay so that's the third person and liao fan talks about

63
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,220
a fourth person he has a really good essay and then the first person who passed the writing exam

64
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:19,940
came out he's also like a regular student and and he padded back with a very good Milky Way like page

65
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,660
and he came to university on a nose job yayayayayaya and exactly that way no more process and then the third

66
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:26,420
but he's very arrogant so that year the test result came out he didn't pass the

67
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:31,040
test and start screaming he said the examiner must be blind couldn't see my

68
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,120
real talent he started screaming and yelling and there was a Taoist monk

69
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:41,180
walked by and started laughing at him he redirected his anger toward the monk he

70
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:47,360
said why are you laughing monk said you must not write very good essays and he

71
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,920
said how do you know you haven't even seen my essay and the monk says in order

72
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:56,780
to write good essay you must have good temperament you must have a peaceful

73
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:01,700
mind with your anger and you must not write very good essay and then he said

74
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:06,860
how can I start passing the test what can I do to change my life the monk said

75
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:12,140
you know from now on you should be humble and change your way cultivate

76
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:17,140
good deeds you will pass the exam then he said how can I do good deeds I'm

77
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:22,600
just a poor student monk says you know being humble that doesn't cost any money

78
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:28,580
that is hidden virtue that is already very good deed so from that day on he

79
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:33,340
controlled himself had great discipline and so he did that for three years one

80
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:37,540
night he had a dream he went to the underworld he saw someone with this

81
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:42,460
booklet this booklet had a lot of names and some blank spaces he asked the

82
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:47,080
person next to him what is this book he said oh this book is all the

83
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:51,940
people that's going to pass the Imperial exam this year the blank spaces

84
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:57,580
are people that didn't do good deeds so their name has been erased you on the

85
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,660
other hand these three years you have been doing really well so your name is

86
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:06,700
going to fill one of the blank spaces and sure enough after he had that dream

87
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:12,480
he passed the exam that year so all these people by being humble actually

88
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,380
attract good fortune but you don't want good fortune and

89
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:22,420
it's better to do good deeds just for yourself it's better that you want it

90
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:26,400
for the entire world you want to benefit of the whole society

91
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:33,380
Mencius told an emperor that it's great that you love music but you loving music

92
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:39,880
is just a personal pleasure if you can put this love of music for all the

93
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:45,940
people in your country and make them happy as well your whole country will be

94
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,940
prosperous

95
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:51,460
always improve themselves so this lifetime if you stay humble and virtuous

96
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:56,860
you will do a lot more and you can benefit the entire world that's it for

97
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:00,880
the Liao Fanzhou lesson and next time we will talk about something else

98
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,420
thank you for listening
