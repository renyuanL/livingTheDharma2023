00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,480
Today we are going to talk about Pure Sixth Sense Organs.

2
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:25,080
We create karma that perpetuates rebirth through our sixth sense organs, but it is also through

3
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,520
our sixth sense organs we become enlightened.

4
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,800
Therefore we take the same road back home.

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:38,240
We will use the Shravagama Sutra to understand how to purify our sixth sense organs.

6
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,280
First we need to understand the origins of our afflictions.

7
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:49,140
The main problem is our sixth sense organs, they always chase after sensory objects.

8
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,260
Now let's look at the sensory objects.

9
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,880
Every organ has two types of objects.

10
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,200
Our eyes, when there is light, we see everything.

11
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,080
When there is darkness, we see blackness.

12
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,280
Our ears, when we hear sound, it's called movement.

13
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,400
When there is no sound, it's called stillness.

14
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,020
Our nose, when it's clear, it's called penetration.

15
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:15,200
When it's congested, it's called obstruction.

16
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,760
Our tongue, when we taste plain food, it's called blandness.

17
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,680
When we taste a lot of variety of different flavors, such as spicy, sour, sweet, sour,

18
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,620
bitter, it's called variety.

19
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:33,240
Our body, when it's in contact with object, it's called union.

20
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,700
When it's in isolation, it's called separation.

21
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,240
Our mind, when it has thoughts arising, it's called production.

22
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,580
When the thought disappears, it's called extinction.

23
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:49,140
So we're forever chasing after the sixth sense objects.

24
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,840
There's two kinds of sensory organs, one is called the pure sensory organs and one is

25
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,840
called the super sensory organs.

26
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:03,040
Superficial sensory organs, the superficial sensory organs is what we see on the outside.

27
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:11,120
And the pure sixth sense organs, they are the refined, invisible elements of our organs.

28
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,440
So let's first talk about the superficial organs.

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,700
They are easy to understand.

30
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:20,040
For example, our eyes are shaped like grapes.

31
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,220
Our ears are shaped like fresh coral leaves.

32
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,660
Our nose is shaped like a double hanging claw.

33
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,060
Our tongue is shaped like crescent moon.

34
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,980
Our body is shaped like a table.

35
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:37,460
Actually it's not a table, it's like a drum that is narrower in the waist, like the shape

36
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,780
of a human.

37
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,040
Our mind is like seeing in the dark room.

38
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,160
So these are very vivid descriptions of our sixth sense organs.

39
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:54,500
But in the inside, we actually have pure elements of our sixth sense organs that's attaching

40
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,500
to the sensory organs.

41
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,600
Our sensory objects are pure organs combined with the form.

42
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,260
For example, we might be attached to what we see all the time.

43
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:10,580
Some people, they might be attached to social media, always watching for other people's

44
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:14,660
comments because that's what they think will give them happiness.

45
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:21,500
Or when we see a medical report, all the numbers that is getting worse, then we might become

46
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,900
very depressed.

47
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,900
Whatever we see, it totally drives our senses.

48
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,340
It drives our emotions.

49
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,720
Our ears resounds with sound.

50
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,740
So our ears pursue after the sounds.

51
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:39,380
For example, if you hear that you are being promoted, you're very happy.

52
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:43,840
If you hear that you're getting laid off, then you become very upset.

53
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,040
So our emotion follows what we hear every day.

54
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,400
Our nose, it takes incense.

55
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,000
For example, if you smell a homeless person, the odor is not very strong.

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So our nose, it takes incense.

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,880
For example, if you smell a homeless person, the odor is not very strong.

58
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,880
So our nose, it takes incense.

59
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:01,660
You might have negative feelings or look down on the person, but you forgot that this person

60
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:07,340
has the Buddha nature, and you, as someone who has the Buddha nature, should not look

61
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,020
down on anyone.

62
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,620
Our tongue is entwined with flavor.

63
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:18,040
When we taste our favorite food, such as chocolate cake or ice cream, we're full of desires.

64
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,080
Our body seizes upon contact.

65
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,980
We love to touch soft things or soft skins.

66
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:31,020
that's also because of our greed and our mind grabs onto the dharma we have a lot of thoughts

67
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:37,740
a lot of time our thought is full of negativity and we can think ourselves into depression

68
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:46,540
so we are always grabbing on to the sensory object that's why we cannot be enlightened what we need

69
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:54,780
to do is to go inward stop seeking outward everything should be inward to your own self

70
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:02,540
nature see the essence there's actually this essence in our sixth sense organs the closest

71
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:10,060
thing to our buddha nature it is actually still the alaya consciousness before it start thinking

72
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:16,460
discriminating and perceiving or ignorant that's the closest to who we really are

73
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:22,060
to the body and our heart we have an essence of seeing we have essence all hearing essence of

74
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:31,020
smelling essence of tasting essence of sensation essence of knowing only if we go inward

75
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:38,140
can we see our essence when we do not follow the 12 conditioned appearances

76
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:46,220
of the objects our pure essence will emerge when clarity is pure to its essence no matter what

77
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:46,300
happens there is a decisiveness as you can see in udahika's life happens to need the information

78
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:46,340
and soon as the Laguna times started I realized there were a bunch of asian Yasmin or as the

79
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:52,520
is no affliction how do we come back to this essence now let's look at the

80
00:05:52,520 --> 00:06:00,560
efficacy Buddha gives every organ a score the perfect score is 1200 how do

81
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,560
we come up with 1200 is the four directions of east west north south

82
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:14,180
times the three periods of past present and future times the ten dharma rounds

83
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:20,420
of the physical world times the ten dharma rounds of the inner truth level so

84
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:28,000
together it has a perfect score of 1200 looking at our eyes it only gets 800

85
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,860
because we see the front and left and right we do not see the back so it's

86
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:40,880
deficient by a third therefore it only gets the score of 800 merits our ear it

87
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,160
can hear everywhere all directions

88
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:50,640
therefore it gets a perfect score of 1200 our nose is deficient at the point

89
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:56,980
between inhalation and exhalation therefore it's deficient by a third as

90
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:03,440
well it gets a score of 800 our tongue gets a score of 1200 the perfect score

91
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:10,720
because it can proclaim all worldly and transcendental wisdom and our body only

92
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,140
gets 800 because when it's in union with the earth it only gets 800 because when it's in union

93
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:20,680
with in contact with objects it can feel pain or pleasure so each deserves a

94
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:27,940
third, when our body is separated it's not functioning so it is deficient by a

95
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:35,500
third as well so it gets a score of 800 our mind gets a score of 1200 because it

96
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:41,180
can know all the worldly and transcendental Dharma therefore it gets

97
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,020
a perfect score of 1200 so how do we learn from the previous 3 dharma lines

98
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:51,880
do we use this is to help us narrow it down to one sense organ to go inward so

99
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:58,800
to narrow down further we should know that the nose tongue and body need to be

100
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:05,980
united with the object for it to be useful so we eliminate them the eyes

101
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:11,360
ears and mind they are more useful because they don't need to come in

102
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:17,120
direct contact with the object. We narrow down to these three the mind itself

103
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:24,160
is more deep and the eyes and ears are more shallow the deeper ones are harder

104
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,400
to control because our mind our thoughts change all the time so we are left with

105
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:36,020
the eyes and the years the eyes has 800 points and the ears gets a perfect score

106
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:40,260
therefore the final result is the ears. We

107
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,300
need to

108
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:41,320
go back to you and try to do the same thing

109
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:41,360
same thing again again and again so always I encourage you to expect ging to go and Morgen to wear your ears because I need you inside

110
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:50,160
back to our essence through our hearing. This is the way that Guanyin Bodhisattva cultivates.

111
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:58,340
He enters the flow through the hearing and forgot all sensory object. So we need to return

112
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:06,600
the hearing, listen to the self nature till it reaches the supreme way. Do not go outward.

113
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:12,600
Listen to all the sound. What this person is saying, not saying. Always go back to who

114
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:20,440
you are. Know your essence. That's when you will reach the supreme way, the perfect enlightenment.

115
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:27,820
This way of cultivation is the best way to return to our nature because it's very easy

116
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:36,120
to concentrate our mind inward through hearing. When you have the way cultivating for one

117
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,560
day, you will be able to go back to your essence. You will be able to go back to your essence.

118
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:36,580
You will be able to go back to your essence. You will be able to go back to your essence.

119
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:44,060
It's the same as cultivating for eons. That is the same way as great strength Bodhisattva's

120
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:51,540
way of Buddha remembrance Samadhi. He chanted the name Amitabha, gathered in all the six

121
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:59,340
sense organs, have continuous pure mindfulness of the name Amitabha. That's how he reached

122
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:06,540
Samadhi and perfect penetration. We can all do this by going inward.

123
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:14,220
So the conclusion is, as soon as one sense organ return to the source, the entire six

124
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:22,420
are liberated. It just takes one, the years, then you are liberated. Enter one falsely

125
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:30,400
and all six sense organs simultaneously become pure. It is how we return to our source,

126
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:36,500
to our essence. This is called entering emptiness from existence.

127
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:43,600
That's how we become self-enlightened. But when we want to go help all sentient beings,

128
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:50,480
we need to turn it around. Enter existence from emptiness. That's when we use the six

129
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:58,900
sense organs. Lodge at the organs is the revelation of the brightness that permits the mutual function

130
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:06,460
of the six organs. When your six sense organs are perfectly pure, they can be used interchangeably

131
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:14,640
. Your ears can see, your eyes can taste, so everything is possible. Why? Because you

132
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:21,860
are no longer attached to the objects. You are not bound by this world anymore. This

133
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:28,340
is the power that we all have inside of us. We just forgot it because we are so attached

134
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:34,560
to the world. As soon as we go inward, we will have this ability back. That's what happened

135
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,140
to all the big bodhisattvas.

136
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:44,040
Always know what your six sense organs are doing. When they are chasing outward, bring

137
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:51,840
them back. Extract them inward and free them. Subdue them from the inner core. Once it's

138
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:58,640
subdued, it will return to the inherent truth and radiate with its inner brilliance.

139
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,700
So that's the class for today. Thank you for listening. Amitabha.
