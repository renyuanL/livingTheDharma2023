1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,160
Today we are going to talk about motivating yourself.

2
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,440
We all want to be a hero, a man of greatness, reaching excellence.

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,720
But how do we motivate ourselves to keep going when we face a lot of obstacles?

4
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,680
Today we will discuss Mencius' great quote on motivation.

5
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,640
Hopefully it will inspire you to succeed in all your endeavors.

6
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,400
When the Heaven is about to place a great responsibility on one man,

7
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:50,640
it always first frustrates his spirit and will, exhausts his muscles and bones,

8
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:58,080
exposes him to starvation and poverty, harasses him by troubles and setbacks.

9
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:03,840
When the Heaven is about to place a great responsibility on one man,

10
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,960
this great responsibility is becoming a saint and a sage, reaching Buddhahood.

11
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,320
We have a calling, we are inheriting the Buddha's family business

12
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,480
of saving all sentient beings out of reincarnation.

13
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,480
That's a heroic mission.

14
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,280
We need to be trained in four ways.

15
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,920
First, it frustrates his spirit.

16
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,760
He would be trained in a lot of hardships and difficulties.

17
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:39,520
The struggles and the hardships are our teachers that will make us grow spiritually.

18
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,920
Confucius had a student, his name is Ziqian Ming.

19
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,800
His mother passed away when he was young.

20
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,880
His father remarried and he was raised by his stepmother.

21
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,880
His stepmother gave birth to two younger brothers but mistreated Ziqian.

22
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:06,640
He was often verbally and physically abused, but Ziqian never had any complaint and never had any resentment toward his stepmother.

23
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:16,620
In the winter, the stepmother would line the clothing of her own children with warm cotton and would line Ziqian's clothing with weeds.

24
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,280
One day, it was snowing. His father asked him to drive the carriage.

25
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:28,280
So Ziqian was shivering uncontrollably and lost control of the carriage.

26
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:36,000
So his father was furious and whipped him with the horse whip, his clothes ripped, and all the weed petals came out.

27
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,540
The father realized that his son was being abused by his stepmother.

28
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:46,040
They immediately went home, and the dad wanted to divorce the stepmother.

29
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,840
But Ziqian sincerely pleaded,

30
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,920
Father, when mother is here,

31
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,920
only I am cold.

32
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,920
If mother leaves, then three of us would be cold.

33
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:06,420
The father let stepmom stay, and stepmother was very touched and felt ashamed of her behavior.

34
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:12,920
From that day on, she changed her way, and the family lived in harmony ever since.

35
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:19,920
So by the virtue of this great boy, he changed the life of the family.

36
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,440
So through hardship,

37
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,440
our greatness and virtue comes out.

38
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:33,440
We say the most neglected child is usually the more mature, more successful, and has the most filial piety.

39
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,440
So no matter how hard your family life is,

40
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,440
you want to bring out your filial piety, your respect, and love.

41
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,440
Number two, exhaust his muscles and bones.

42
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,440
Just like you want to be a professional athlete,

43
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,440
you need to train diligently.

44
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,440
With discipline, and go through all the hardcore trainings.

45
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,440
There were two rocks and a sculptor.

46
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,440
The sculptor went to the first rock and started carving.

47
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,440
But the first rock started complaining,

48
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,440
ouch, you're hurting me, you're hurting me, stop it.

49
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,440
The rock kept complaining, so the sculptor could not take it anymore,

50
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:17,440
and said, fine, you take a break, I will work on the second rock.

51
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,440
So he went to the second rock and started carving,

52
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,440
and the second rock said, I will not make a sound,

53
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,440
I will endure any kind of pain and difficulties.

54
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,440
The sculptor calmly carved for two weeks,

55
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,440
and finally made a magnificent statue of Shakyamuni Buddha.

56
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,440
Thousands of people came to pay respect and worship the statue.

57
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,440
So they needed something to lie on the ground,

58
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,440
so people can prostrate and bow on.

59
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,440
So they decided to break the first rock,

60
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,440
into little pieces of pebbles for people to bow on.

61
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:59,440
If you can endure the pain in the working process,

62
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,440
you will definitely reach greatness at the end.

63
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,440
Just like a stone we want to make into a piece of artwork,

64
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:13,440
into a jade, we need to polish and grind over and over,

65
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,440
until it becomes a masterpiece of artwork.

66
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,440
Number three,

67
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,440
exposes him to starvation and poverty.

68
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,440
In Taiwan, there was a nun.

69
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,440
Before she became a nun, she was a doctor of oncology.

70
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,440
One day came a 50-year-old breast cancer patient.

71
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,440
Her medicine was not yet approved by the insurance.

72
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,440
She felt a great financial burden,

73
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,440
and she felt the great pain of her sickness.

74
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,440
So uncontrollably, she started crying.

75
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,440
Next door, there was also a 30-year-old breast cancer patient.

76
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,440
She overheard the whole thing,

77
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,440
and asked the doctor to go outside.

78
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,440
And she whispered to the doctor,

79
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,440
Can you please give this money to that lady?

80
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,440
Because we are all suffering the same fate.

81
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,440
I just want to be able to help her in any way I can.

82
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,440
The doctor was extremely touched,

83
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,440
because she knew this lady

84
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,440
is even in greater hardship than the first lady.

85
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,440
Her child is still an infant,

86
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,440
and her husband doesn't make much money,

87
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,440
and she doesn't even have insurance.

88
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,440
For many times, because she didn't have enough money,

89
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,440
she forfeited treatment.

90
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,440
So she's going through so much hardship,

91
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,440
and she can still find it in her heart to help a stranger.

92
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,440
So the harder the hardship,

93
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,440
the greater we have to hold on to our virtues.

94
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,440
And our compassion.

95
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,440
Just like the cherry blossom,

96
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,440
the colder it gets, the prettier it blooms.

97
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,440
Number four, harasses him by troubles and setbacks.

98
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,440
Even if you work very hard,

99
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,440
you might still face a lot of troubles and setbacks.

100
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,440
Just like Buddha's disciple,

101
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,440
Purna Maitrayani Putra.

102
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,440
One day he asked Buddha,

103
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,440
May I please go to that remote country

104
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,440
and teach Buddhism?

105
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,440
Buddha said, Are you sure?

106
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,440
They are all very vicious and barbaric.

107
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,440
What if they started berating you?

108
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,440
Purna said, I will still be very thankful.

109
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,440
At least they didn't hit me with a stick.

110
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,440
And Buddha said, What if they start hitting you with a stick?

111
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,440
Purna said, I will still be thankful.

112
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,440
At least they didn't use a blade to cut me.

113
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,440
Buddha said, What if they start using a blade to cut you?

114
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,440
Purna said, I will still be thankful.

115
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,440
At least they didn't kill me.

116
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,440
Buddha said, What if they killed you?

117
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,440
Purna said, I will still be so thankful.

118
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,440
I will have reached Nirvana.

119
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:57,440
Buddha said, With this great determination and boldly resolve,

120
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,440
you can now go.

121
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,440
So he went to the country.

122
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,440
Everybody hated him and started berating him.

123
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,440
But he didn't care.

124
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,440
He went to the hospital and started taking care of the sick.

125
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,440
Then he started to teach them how to read and write.

126
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,440
And gave them education.

127
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,440
He showed them how to farm the land so they would have food for themselves.

128
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,440
Finally, he earned the trust of all the people.

129
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,440
And then that's when he started teaching them Dharma.

130
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,440
Soon the entire country became Buddhist.

131
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,440
And he built a Sangha of 500 people.

132
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,440
No matter how hard and how much troubles and setbacks,

133
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,440
we have to keep going until we reach our goal.

134
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,440
Just like to make iron ore into steel.

135
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,440
We need to keep burning it in high heat.

136
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:56,440
And pound it and burn it over and over until it becomes useful steel.

137
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,440
So the result is,

138
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,440
toughen our spirit,

139
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,440
soften our nature,

140
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,440
and enhance our abilities.

141
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,440
So first we need to toughen our spirit.

142
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,440
This is the Voi meditation.

143
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,440
Which means understanding the emptiness of all obstacles.

144
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,440
No matter how big the obstacle seems,

145
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,440
it's only in our mind.

146
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,440
It's not real.

147
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,440
There's no obstacle too big for you.

148
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,440
You want to have the steel backbone.

149
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,440
Always go toward your greatness and your virtue.

150
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,440
And never give up no matter how hard the situation may seem.

151
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,440
Second, you want to soften your nature.

152
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,440
Train yourself in this unreal world.

153
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,440
This is the unreal meditation.

154
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,440
Which means in this unreal conditioned existence,

155
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,440
we want to be the best that we can be.

156
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,440
Be tolerant and forgiving toward everybody.

157
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,440
Inside, you are tough.

158
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,440
On the outside, you need to train yourself to be extremely soft.

159
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:05,440
So you don't have an ounce of resentment toward anything or anyone.

160
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,440
Finally, you will enhance your abilities.

161
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,440
That's the Ming meditation.

162
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,440
When you balance the Voi and the unreal,

163
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,440
when you balance the toughness and the softness,

164
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,440
you will come to great ability.

165
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,440
You now are able to take on the great responsibility

166
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,440
of becoming a saint and a sage that's going to save the world.

167
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,440
This world is a Buddha selecting field.

168
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,440
You want to be the chosen one to take on the great responsibility

169
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,440
of saying being awesome.

170
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,440
To become a saint and being,

171
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,440
you need to go through the hardship and the obstacles.

172
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,440
Each of us is responsible for the fate of our family,

173
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,440
our country, our world.

174
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,440
So it's now time for us to bring out the best in us.

175
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,440
Use the hardship to bring out our great compassion,

176
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,440
our great innate wisdom,

177
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,440
our determination, our virtue and nobility.

178
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,440
So together,

179
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,440
we will prevail.

180
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,440
There's definitely light at the end of the tunnel.

181
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,440
So that's the class for today.

182
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,440
Thank you for listening.

183
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,440
Aum Tofu.
