1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,240
Letting go of what? Letting go of our false thinking, our attachment to this body and mind.

2
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,940
We will use two verses from the past seven Buddhas to explain how to let go.

3
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,940
The body is born from formless.

4
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,260
If you look at this body, it has form and appearance.

5
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,680
But if you see for its origin, it's actually empty and formless.

6
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:48,720
When the elements of earth, water, fire, and wind unite, the body comes into being.

7
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:53,500
But when the cause conditions disperse, the body no longer exists.

8
00:00:53,500 --> 00:01:01,500
Therefore, the nature is emptiness, as all forms are manifested as illusion.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Illusion is another word for emptiness.

10
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,500
It's like we are in a dream.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
When we wake up from the dream, why should we hold on to the things that are in the dream?

12
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,000
We need to recognize that we are actually in a dream state.

13
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,000
So that was talking about the body, now let's talk about the mind.

14
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,000
The consciousness of the illusion.

15
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:28,000
This illusionary creature is originally insubstantial.

16
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:38,000
This illusionary creature is us because our mind is the deluded mind, the basic ignorance consciousness.

17
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,000
So we are actually the dream mind.

18
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,000
If we wake up, then we are the Buddha mind.

19
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,000
So all we have to do is to wake up from this dream state.

20
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,000
And how do we wake up?

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,500
We need to truly understand the essence of our body and mind.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,500
In Buddhism, we talk about our body and mind as the five aggregates or the five skandhas.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,500
It's made out of form, feeling, perception, mental formation, and consciousness.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:19,500
So the body is the form, the other four, feeling, perception, mental formation, and consciousness, that make up our mind.

25
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:27,000
We are all clinging to these five skandhas and we don't even know it's our delusion.

26
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,000
First is our form.

27
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,000
This is the thing we are both attached to.

28
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,000
But it's actually made out of matters.

29
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,000
In Buddhism, there are 32 elements in the body.

30
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,000
And it's full of molecules and cells.

31
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,000
It's constantly changing and it's not reliable.

32
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,000
We try to cling and try to make ourselves look good.

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,500
We're self-conscious about our weight, about how we look when we have wrinkles or going bald.

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,500
Every day we're working on this body, which is a delusion.

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We are attached to our feelings.

36
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,500
We can have the feeling of pleasure, displeasure, or neutral.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,500
But our feeling is a reaction to the external world.

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,500
So our feeling, our emotion, is very unstable.

39
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,000
Because it's controlled by the external environment.

40
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,000
Then is our perception.

41
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,000
This is our thinking.

42
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,000
Our thinking follows our feelings.

43
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:31,000
If we like something, it's pleasurable, we develop greed and we want more.

44
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:38,000
If it's displeasure, we develop hatred or anger and we try to get rid of it.

45
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:44,000
So our thinking can be very polluted if it's based on our feelings.

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,500
Then we have the mental formation.

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,500
It's the activities of the mind.

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,500
Now it's becoming a very strong judgment and discrimination.

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,500
It's full of the personality.

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,500
So it's a very strong image of a self.

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,500
And this activity compounds exponentially.

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,500
So this becomes a very strong ego and very strong self.

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,500
Then we have consciousness.

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,500
Which is the subtle basis for our feeling perception.

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,500
And formation.

56
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,500
Basically it's our alaya consciousness, the storehouse, that takes us to all the reincarnation.

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,500
So why do we reincarnate?

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,500
It's actually our clinging to the five skandhas that is causing the vicious cycle of reincarnation.

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,500
Buddha tells us to look at them carefully and recognize their emptiness.

60
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,500
That way we can really be awakened and out of the suffering.

61
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,500
So Buddha used simple metaphors for us to see its emptiness.

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
For our form, we should look at it like foam.

63
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,500
A mass of bubbles, it doesn't really keep its shape.

64
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,500
We should look at our feelings like bubbles.

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,500
It doesn't last at all.

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,500
Look at our perception like a mirage.

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,500
It's actually an optical illusion from the reflection of light.

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,500
And we should see our mental formation

69
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,000
like the plantain tree.

70
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,000
When you take out all the leaves of the plantain tree,

71
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,000
it actually doesn't have a core remaining.

72
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:26,000
And we should see our consciousness as the magician pulling a rabbit out of the hat.

73
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,000
It's actually an illusion by a sleight of hand.

74
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,000
So all these are just illusions.

75
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,000
We are attached to something that is not trustworthy.

76
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,000
There was a famous Russian writer.

77
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
He wrote a lot of very famous novels.

78
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,000
But his family life was full of suffering.

79
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,000
He married the woman that he loved.

80
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,000
But the woman was jealous in nature.

81
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,000
She was even jealous of their own children.

82
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,000
One time she grabbed a gun and shot a hole through the daughter's photo.

83
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,000
So they fought every day.

84
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:08,000
And the worst thing is he kept a private diary blaming everything on the wife.

85
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,500
The wife saw it.

86
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
She was very upset.

87
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,000
She tore out pages, burned it.

88
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,000
And she wrote her own diary making him the villain.

89
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,000
She actually even wrote a novel titled Whose Fault?

90
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,000
She put all the blame on him.

91
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:29,000
They turned the only home they have into what Tolstoy called a lunatic asylum.

92
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,000
So why do these two people live like this?

93
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:38,000
Because they are so attached to their feelings, perception, and formation.

94
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,500
They lost control.

95
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Neither of them have the sense to say stop.

96
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,000
That's how we are deluded in our lives right now.

97
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,000
So the key is to let go, to wake up and see the truth.

98
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:58,000
Lastly, either sin or rightness is of emptiness and non-abiding.

99
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:05,500
Karma, retribution from our sin and rightness, they are also empty in nature.

100
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,500
And it's not abiding.

101
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,500
It's always changing.

102
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,500
When it's caused and conditioned, it's constantly changing and has duality,

103
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,500
which means it's not abiding.

104
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,500
It must be empty in essence.

105
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,500
So anything that has a form that is changing is not for us to rely on.

106
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,500
We need to go back to the essence, which is emptiness.

107
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,500
In the Shogama Sutra, Buddha tells the story about Yajna Dada.

108
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:44,500
On impulse one morning, Yajna Dada held a mirror and he fell in love with the head in the mirror.

109
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,500
And he thought he lost his own head.

110
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So he ran frantically around the city looking for his head.

111
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,000
Until someone went to him and told him,

112
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,000
You have your head. You never lost your head.

113
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,500
Then that's when he woke up from his madness.

114
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So why did Buddha tell us about Yajna Dada?

115
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,000
Because we are Yajna Dada.

116
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,000
We fell in love with the head in the mirror.

117
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,000
That's our deluded mind that we're using right now.

118
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:20,000
We felt like we lost our own head, which is our Buddha nature, our true mind.

119
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,000
So we went frantically searching for it when we don't need to

120
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,000
because we never lost our head in the first place.

121
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,000
When the causes and conditions of the madness ceases,

122
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,000
the nature that is not mad will naturally come forth.

123
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,000
So this is the famous line.

124
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,000
When madness ceases, bodhi appears.

125
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:46,000
We just have to let go of our madness, of our greed, anger, ignorance.

126
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:51,000
When it stops, the bodhi actually comes forth naturally.

127
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:56,000
Our supreme, pure, bright mind originally prevailed the Dharma realm.

128
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,000
That is our true mind.

129
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,000
So we don't have to work so hard to look for our head.

130
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,500
And we don't have to work so hard trying to gain certification of Buddhahood.

131
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,500
Because we already have it within us.

132
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,500
The second verse of this Buddha is telling us just that.

133
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,500
It is Buddha's body to know the body as insubstantial.

134
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,500
This is talking about the first two lines about the body.

135
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,500
When you recognize that your body is empty, then you have the Buddha body.

136
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,500
We call it the Dharma body.

137
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,500
It is the Buddha's illusion to perceive the mind as illusion.

138
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,500
That's talking about the two lines here.

139
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,500
When you see our conscience, our mind is actually illusion.

140
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,500
That's Buddha's knowing.

141
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,500
That's Buddha's illusion.

142
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,500
The two together perceiving the emptiness of body and mind in essence.

143
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,500
There is no difference between him and Buddha.

144
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,500
If we can just understand the emptiness

145
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,500
of our body and mind,

146
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,500
then this person is Buddha.

147
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,500
So this is the powerful prajna that will end all the suffering.

148
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,500
This is called enlightenment.

149
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,500
So all the past Buddha is telling us exactly the same thing.

150
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,500
We already have it within us.

151
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,500
We just have to let go the madness.

152
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,500
Let go the delusion.

153
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,500
Lastly, we will end with the story in Lotus Sutra

154
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,000
about the parable of the impoverished son.

155
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,000
There was a boy that ran away from home for many years.

156
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,000
He became very poor and confused.

157
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:46,000
His father loved him very much but had no idea where to go look for him.

158
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,000
Over the years, the father became very rich.

159
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,000
Fifty years passed.

160
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,000
One day, the boy showed up in the father's estate.

161
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,000
The father recognized his son right away.

162
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
But the son did not recognize his father.

163
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,500
So the father sent a messenger to greet him.

164
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
But he thought they were trying to arrest him.

165
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,500
And he was so scared, he actually fainted.

166
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So the father said to leave him alone.

167
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:17,000
Later, the father asked the servants to dress in rags

168
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,500
and to offer him a job as a janitor.

169
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
In the olden days, that means shoveling excrements.

170
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,500
He gladly accepted the job and thought it was perfect for him.

171
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And he did it for twenty years.

172
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:35,000
At twenty years, he got promoted, got involved in the family business,

173
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,000
and became the head manager of the family business.

174
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:44,000
Before his death, the father gathered all the friends

175
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,500
and all the important people of the city to his bedside.

176
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,500
He then revealed the identity of his true son.

177
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
His son inherited all the family wealth.

178
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,000
So the rich father is Buddha.

179
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,000
We are the son.

180
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,000
We already have the wealth within us.

181
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,000
That's our Buddha nature.

182
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,000
So we actually don't have to work that twenty years

183
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,500
and wait for certification.

184
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,500
If we just let go of all the delusion,

185
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
we immediately go back to our true self.

186
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,000
If the madness ceases, Bodhi appears.

187
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,000
If we can just let go

188
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
of our clinging to the body and mind,

189
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,500
then we will realize,

190
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
oh, there's actually nothing to cling to.

191
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,500
You will feel this relief

192
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
and be back to who you really are.

193
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,500
Use this prajna to transform your whole life.

194
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,500
And you will be enlightened.

195
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,500
So that's the class for today.

196
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Thank you for listening. Amitabha.
