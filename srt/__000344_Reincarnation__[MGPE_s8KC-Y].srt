1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Today we are going to talk about reincarnation, which means the continuation of birth and death, lifetime after lifetime.

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This is not our first lifetime. We've been reincarnated millions of times.

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Today we are going to understand reincarnation as discussed in the Sravagama Sutra.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Reincarnation according to the Sutra has three kinds of continuity.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The first one is the continuity of the world.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Two is the continuity of living beings.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Three is the continuity of karmic retribution.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Let's first look at the continuity of the world.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
How does the world come about?

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
First, we have the original enlightened mind.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Unfortunately, it becomes agitated, and it starts having movement.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Then it becomes the alaya consciousness, the mind that has rising and ceasing.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Because of the movement of our mind, it creates a big empty space.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The perpetual rotation of space becomes the wind, and we have the wind that supports the world.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
When the emptiness hardens, it sets up the solidity, which is the store of metal,

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
which supports the earth, the land.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
When the wind and the metal rub together, it creates the light of fire.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Then we have the fire wheel.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The brightness of the metal creates moisture, and from the light of the fire, steam arises.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That's when we have water.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So we have the four basic elements that create this world.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So is our body.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Wind, which is our breathing.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Metal, our bones.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Fire is our temperature.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Water is our saliva, our blood.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
All the elements that comes from the cause and conditions, the karmic seeds,

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
store in our alaya consciousness, creating the entire world and our bodies.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
None of it is real.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The nature of all these things is emptiness.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's just cause and conditions, and rising and ceasing.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
From these four elements, we have the four kinds of habitats.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Fire rises, water falls.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The combination creates the solidity.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What is wet becomes oceans and seas.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
What is dry becomes continents and islands.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And when the power of water is less than the power of fire, it produces high mountains.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:49,000
When the power of earth is less than the power of water, it becomes grass and trees, and it becomes groves and meadows.

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
That's why we have four kinds of habitats of ocean, islands, mountains, and meadows.

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Our own alaya consciousness created the four kinds of habitats.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Some people love to live by the ocean.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Some love to live in the islands.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Some live in the cities.

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Some live in the valleys.

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Our alaya consciousness has different cause and conditions.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
There's no coincidence where you live right now.

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's all because of our karma.

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Now let's look at the continuity.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
There are three of living beings.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
This is our environment.

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
This is our birth.

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
There are four kinds of birth.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The first one is egg-born.

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Two is womb-born.

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Three is moisture-born.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Four is transformation body.

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The egg-borns come from thoughts.

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
If we have a lot of wandering thoughts, we're likely to become an egg-born,

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
such as feather, vertebrates, chicken, birds.

60
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's all coming out of thoughts.

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Our mind creates life and death.

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's all because of our alaya consciousness.

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
That's why we try to meditate.

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
We quiet our mind so it has less wandering thoughts,

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
and it doesn't create so much life and death.

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Then we have the womb-born, which are mammals.

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
That's due to emotions.

68
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
If we have a lot of emotions of happiness, sadness, anger, greed,

69
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
we are likely to become a mammal.

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
This mammal needs four kinds of conditions.

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
A mother, a father, individual's karma, and warmth.

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Then we have life.

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Then we have the moisture-born, which is like insects, like mosquitoes.

74
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
They arise from union.

75
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The union of sunlight and moisture that creates the moisture-born.

76
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Lastly is the transformation body that occurs through separation.

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The opposite of moisture is from union.

78
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
This is from separation.

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You are separated from the old body to become the new transformation body,

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
just like butterflies.

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
They need to leave the old caterpillar body to become a butterfly.

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
There are lots of transformation bodies in the six realms of incarnation.

83
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Heavenly beings are transformation bodies.

84
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Hungry ghosts are transformation bodies.

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
When we go to Amitabha's Western Pure Land,

86
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
we are the transformation body of the lotus.

87
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
There's no doubt that we've been through all of these four kinds of births in our reincarnation.

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
During the reign of Emperor Wu of Liang,

89
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
there was a Master Zhigong.

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Master Zhigong had the ability to see people's previous lives.

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
One time he was passing by a wedding.

92
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
He said,

93
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
How strange, how bizarre.

94
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The grandson is marrying the grandmother.

95
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Pigs and sheep sitting in the chair.

96
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The six close kin cook in the brazier.

97
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
People get together to celebrate.

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I see it all as a form of suffering.

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The groom of the wedding is the grandson.

100
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The bride is the grandmother.

101
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Because when the grandmother passed away,

102
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
the person she loves the most is her grandson.

103
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
That's why she reincarnated as a woman and marries her grandson.

104
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The pigs and sheep were eaten by this family before,

105
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
but now they are sitting on the chair as guests of the family.

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
The six close kin that ate the pigs and sheep before,

107
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
now they are cooked as dishes to be served on the table.

108
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
People see it as a celebration.

109
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Master Zhigong sees it all as a form of suffering

110
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and sees the truth about reincarnation.

111
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So we've been reincarnated as all these living beings before

112
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
in our prior lifetimes.

113
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Three, continuity of karmic retribution.

114
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It says in the sutra,

115
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You owe me a life.

116
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I have to repay my debt to you.

117
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You love my mind.

118
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I adore your form.

119
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
This is all due to our killing, stealing, and lust.

120
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You owe me a life.

121
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You eat me.

122
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I eat you.

123
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So you owe me a life.

124
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I owe you a life.

125
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
We keep eating each other and keep coming back to kill each other.

126
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So that's reincarnation.

127
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Basically to pay back debt.

128
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I have to repay my debt to you.

129
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You have to repay your debt to me.

130
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Keep stealing from each other.

131
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Then we keep having to pay it back.

132
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Sometimes we become bankrupt this lifetime

133
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
because we've done this to others.

134
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Or it's due to love.

135
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You love my mind.

136
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I adore your form.

137
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You love how I am.

138
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I love your looks.

139
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
We keep having lust and entangle with each other.

140
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The father and mother is consummating.

141
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Our alaya consciousness gets attached to the egg and the sperm.

142
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
That's how we become a living being.

143
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
This is all due to our lust.

144
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
If you are a son, you love the mother.

145
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
If you are the daughter,

146
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
you actually love the dad.

147
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That's how you become a fetus.

148
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
That's all how we got our life.

149
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Because of killing, stealing and lust,

150
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
we go through hundreds and thousands of eons

151
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
of sustained mutual entanglement.

152
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
This is not our first lifetime we've been with these people.

153
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
We've seen them many many many lifetimes

154
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
in different environments.

155
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Maybe we're all pigs together.

156
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Now we're gathered again

157
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
to pay back each other's debt.

158
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
That's what life is all about.

159
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So Buddha wants us to awaken

160
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
from all these reincarnations.

161
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
If you can see that this is all a dream

162
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
created by our deluded consciousness,

163
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
we will be enlightened.

164
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
This is the truth that we need to ponder upon.

165
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
If you do not understand reincarnation,

166
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
you will have no motivation to cultivate.

167
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
In conclusion,

168
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
when the madness ceases,

169
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
just that ceasing is bodhi.

170
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
We need to cease the deluded mind,

171
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
the liar consciousness

172
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
from having these thoughts of killing, stealing and lust.

173
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
If we stop this condition,

174
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
the real cause of greed, anger and ignorance

175
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
will not arise.

176
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That ceasing itself is enlightenment.

177
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What is enlightenment?

178
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Enlightenment is just the ceasing

179
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
of the deluded mind.

180
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
We don't want to keep using the liar consciousness

181
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
that is keeping us through reincarnation.

182
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
We created reincarnation for ourselves.

183
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
We create all the plot in our dream

184
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
from our own karma.

185
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
If we just wake up,

186
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
see the falseness of all appearances

187
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
and we see the truth of the real nature of all things,

188
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
which is emptiness,

189
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
there will be no more reincarnation.

190
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
We need to treasure this lifetime as a human.

191
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
If we really understand the Dharma

192
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
and really cultivate ourselves

193
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
not to be caught up in the world

194
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
and keep having the thoughts of greed, anger and ignorance,

195
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
let go of our attachment to the self,

196
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
then we can really be enlightened.

197
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
All the cultivation,

198
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
all the meditation,

199
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
all the chanting is to wake us up

200
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
so we can be out of reincarnation forever.

201
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
We are in this lifetime present.

202
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
We don't even know that we need to get out.

203
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
If you don't cultivate next lifetime,

204
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
it's more reincarnation waiting for you

205
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
and it will never end.

206
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So that's the class for today.

207
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Thank you for listening.

208
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Amitabha.
