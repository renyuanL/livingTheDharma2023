00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Today we are going to talk about contamination versus purification.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:28,000
There is an old sansa that says do not look afar for the Buddha because the Buddha is on the mountaintop within one's mind.

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Everyone has a pagoda on the mountaintop within one's mind under which one can practice and attain Buddhahood.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So Buddha is not out there on the mountain. It's actually within our own mind.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
All we have to do is purify our mind and our true nature will come out.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Every thought is either a contamination or a purification.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So we need to understand how this permeation works.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It's like a cloth. If you douse it with perfume, it will permeate with fragrance.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
If you soak it in a rancid liquid, it will have a foul smell.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
There are actually four characters in this permeation.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The first one is suchness. Suchness is our pure state of mind. We call it original enlightenment.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Then we have the second character which is ignorance.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Ignorance is when our suchness doesn't stay put.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It started thinking and it's agitated so it's now ignorant which is the state of non-enlightenment.

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Number three, then we will have a deluded mind.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
We now have a perceived subject who is the main person that is thinking.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Number four, erroneously conceived object.

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That is the world of object.

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Because we have a perceiver, now we have the world of object.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Now let's look at contamination.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
There are actually three steps to this.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Number one is ignorance permeates into suchness.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We have basic ignorance which is we separate ourselves from all others.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We forgot about the suchness that is one with the whole entire universe.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's like we were the ocean but now we're a little bubble.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
That's our liar consciousness having its basic ignorance.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And we also will have the ignorance of perverse thoughts and views.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We will now have a lot of likes and dislikes in our sixth consciousness.

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So this ignorance will grow in its power and it's going to try to destroy the original enlightenment, the suchness.

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Number two is deluded mind permeates into ignorance.

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:53,000
This deluded mind is now an activating mind because this mind actually increased the basic ignorance.

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And also it's now an object discriminator.

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's now an activating consciousness.

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The sixth consciousness now is increasing in its perverse views and thoughts.

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So the deluded mind is allying with the ignorance, increasing its power.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So it has more strength to destroy the original suchness.

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Number three, erroneously conceived object permeates into the deluded mind.

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So the world of object that we perceive is now permeated.

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
We are permeating into the deluded mind.

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Now we are accelerating in our deluded thought and we are accelerating in our attachment to the world of objects.

41
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Everything is now contaminated.

42
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It was the suchness but now it's full of contamination.

43
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's all because of this three step process.

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
There was a student of Thale Carnegie.

45
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
He was full of worry.

46
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
He worried about not having a good life.

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
About losing the woman that he loves.

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
About not making enough money.

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Worried about the impression he was making on others.

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
He worried about everything.

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So he had a nervous breakdown.

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He wanted to commit suicide.

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But instead he decided to go travel.

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Before he left his father gave him a letter.

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Tell him not to open it until he reaches his destination.

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So he went to Florida.

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
He didn't feel any better.

58
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
He opened up his father's letter.

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And it said,

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Son, you are 1500 miles away from home.

61
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But you don't feel any different.

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Do you?

63
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's because you took with you the only thing that's troubling you.

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Which is your own mind.

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
If you can just recognize that.

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And know that there's nothing wrong with your life.

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Except how you perceive your life.

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Then you will be cured and you can come home.

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The son did not appreciate the father's letter.

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So he went on the street and started walking.

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
There was a priest giving a sermon on the same subject.

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The priest said,

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
One who can conquer the spirit is mightier than one who can conquer the city.

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
He realized all what his father said is real.

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
All the problem is just how he sees the world.

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
There's no problem at all.

77
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
He went back home.

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Married the woman that he loved.

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
They have five children.

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And he had a great career and a great life after that.

81
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So everything is all perceived.

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
By our own mind.

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Our deluded mind.

84
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
In summary,

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Contamination is non-enlightenment as the primary cause.

86
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And the world of object as the supporting conditions.

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
This is like a tug of war.

88
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
If the side of ignorance, deluded mind and conceived object is winning.

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Then it will be contaminated.

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But if the sexiness is stronger.

91
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Then sexiness will win.

92
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So the dominant will dominate.

93
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So how do we make our sexiness strong?

94
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
We need purification.

95
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Let's look at how purification works.

96
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Number one.

97
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Sexiness permeates into ignorance.

98
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Because we have the sexiness.

99
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
We need to have the sexiness that go into the ignorance.

100
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And destroy the power of the ignorance.

101
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Because the ignorance is not real in the first place.

102
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So how do we make our sexiness grow strong?

103
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
There are two ways.

104
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
One is called the essence permeation.

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And the other is influence permeation.

106
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Let's talk about the essence permeation.

107
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
This is knowing the essence of your mind is the pure suchness.

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
How do you realize your essence?

109
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You need to meditate.

110
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
How do you meditate on the suchness?

111
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You have to have the right contemplation.

112
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Which is on the emptiness.

113
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Focus your attention not on your breathing.

114
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Any form.

115
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Color.

116
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The feeling of your body.

117
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Or any thought.

118
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
The moment that any thought conjures up.

119
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
We immediately discard it.

120
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Even the thought of discarding the thought should be put away.

121
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That is called true mindfulness meditation.

122
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
As this grows stronger and intensifies.

123
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It will be highly effective.

124
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
We call this the samadhi of suchness.

125
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
This is the foundation of all samadhi.

126
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Then we have the influence permeation.

127
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
There are two kinds of influences.

128
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
One is specific influence.

129
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
For example, because you have a good root.

130
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You might attract a lot of bodhisattva that come into your life.

131
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Disguised as your family member.

132
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Or even your servant.

133
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Or even your enemy.

134
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
They will help you bring out your true suchness.

135
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So that's hidden blessing.

136
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And then we can have the general influences.

137
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
That's helping you.

138
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
That's the dharma of the Buddha.

139
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
In chapter five.

140
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The medicinal plant chapter of the lotus sutra.

141
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It talks about us being the medicinal plants.

142
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The plants need two things.

143
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
One from the bottom.

144
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
We need the earth.

145
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So the earth is like our true suchness.

146
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Our Buddha nature.

147
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Earth enables us to grow.

148
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So all plants grow from the earth.

149
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
On the top we have the reign of Buddha.

150
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Which is the dharma.

151
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Buddha equally have the reign fall on us.

152
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And nourish us.

153
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
We need the dharma to nourish us.

154
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
For us to grow into a Buddha.

155
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So Buddha's reign is one appearance.

156
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And one flavor.

157
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
He reigns on everyone equally.

158
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But because our size are different.

159
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Some are little grass.

160
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Some are medium size.

161
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Some are large size.

162
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Some are big trees.

163
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
That's why we absorb the water.

164
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And different of nouns.

165
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Because we are all different in our capabilities.

166
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Buddha's teaching is a general influence.

167
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
That is helping us grow into a Buddha.

168
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Now let's talk about the second one.

169
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The deluded mind permeates into suchness.

170
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
This deluded mind is actually a good deluded mind.

171
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's not like the one above.

172
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
This is full of the dharma.

173
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Trying to help us to be enlightened.

174
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
There are also two kinds.

175
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Object discriminating.

176
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Consciousness.

177
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
This is the mundane person.

178
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And the Theravada Buddhist.

179
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
They are loathing the samsara.

180
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
This is a strong renunciation.

181
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Just like some of us might be very successful in our lives.

182
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And accomplish everything we want.

183
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
But we still feel a sense of emptiness.

184
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
We don't know what to do with our lives.

185
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's like what do we do next?

186
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
We feel empty.

187
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
That's actually because your suchness is calling out to you.

188
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Wanting you to find yourself.

189
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
No one wants to be your spiritual life partner.

190
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
That's the object discriminating.

191
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Consciousness is working.

192
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
But this process is gradual and slower.

193
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So this mind permeates into a bodhisattva.

194
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Who is follow great vows to save all sentient beings.

195
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So they rapidly reach enlightenment.

196
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Because of their aspiration and fortitude.

197
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
This is like the daughter of the naga king.

198
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Described in chapter 12 of the lotus sutra.

199
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Prajnakuta, bodhisattva and the Kang.

200
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,940
Bodhisattva talked to Manjushri Bodhisattva. He asked him, did you save a lot of sentient

201
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:28,560
beings in the world of the ocean, the Naga world? Manjushri Bodhisattva said, yes, actually

202
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,600
there are numerous of them, especially the daughter of the Naga King. She's only eight

203
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,620
years old. She's eloquent, full of compassion, think of all sentient beings as if they're

204
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:46,120
her own children, and she's about to attain instant enlightenment. Prajnakuta Bodhisattva

205
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:52,660
did not believe it. He said, Shakyamuni Buddha went through immeasurable child paths of difficult

206
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:59,140
and severe cultivation in order to reach Buddhahood. How can a little girl like her reach Buddhahood

207
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:04,620
immediately? That's really hard to believe. Before he finished speaking, the daughter

208
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:09,620
of the Naga King appeared in the assembly. She bowed down deeply to them. Then she and

209
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:15,440
the Naga King expounded a verse praising the Buddha and ended with, I will reveal the teaching

210
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,620
of Mahayana and save suffering sentient beings.

211
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:26,260
Sir Puja said to her, how can you obtain instant enlightenment? The female body cannot become

212
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:33,980
a Buddha. She immediately offered a jewel to Buddha. Buddha accepted it. She said, I

213
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:39,120
offered the jewel to Buddha and Buddha accepted it. Was that done quickly? They replied, yes,

214
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:46,240
that was done very quickly. She said, watch me become a Buddha even faster than that.

215
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:52,880
She immediately transformed into a man, perfected all her Bodhisattva practice, went to the Mavela

216
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:59,960
world of the South, sat on a jeweled lotus flower, and immediately reached perfect enlightenment.

217
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:06,240
So the daughter of the Naga King, she became a Buddha because of her great vows and because

218
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,700
she had the suchness inside of her.

219
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,360
It doesn't matter if you're a little girl, you're in the animal realm, or you're a female.

220
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:22,080
You can become a Buddha right here and right now. In summary, purification is original

221
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:29,880
enlightenment of the primary cause and the triple jewel of the supporting conditions.

222
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:35,360
So it's the opposite of the top. It's like we have the nature of the wood to burn, but

223
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,240
if we do not handle it, it will never have fire.

224
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,100

225
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:45,620
So we need to have the triple jewels to help us burn, to help us find our suchness. If

226
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:52,120
the purification is strong, it will destroy the ignorance. Ignorance is actually unreal.

227
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:58,900
If you recognize that ignorance and deluded mind and erroneously conceived objects are

228
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:05,120
unreal, they no longer have any power over you. They will disappear. So if you have your

229
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,120
suchness strong, then the ignorance will cease to exist.
