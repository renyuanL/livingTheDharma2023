1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,400
Today we're going to talk about

2
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,400
inner peace.

3
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,460
How do we have true inner peace?

4
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:38,600
We have inner peace only when we're in line with our true self nature.

5
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:44,080
We have inner peace by not being affected by the outside circumstances.

6
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:50,700
In Buddhism we talk about the outside circumstances in terms of these eight winds.

7
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,720
Our goal is to be unmoved by the eight winds.

8
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,140
So what are the eight winds?

9
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,040
They are four pairs, favorable and unfavorable circumstances.

10
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,140
This is a pair, this is a pair, this is a pair, this is a pair.

11
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,640
So there are four pairs that everybody goes through.

12
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,100
But how do you deal with it to have full inner peace?

13
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,100
That's up to you.

14
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,900
The first is when people praise you.

15
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:21,900
A lot of times you'll get praised, you know, you look beautiful today or you're doing well

16
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,900
in your job.

17
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,900
Your boss, your teacher, your parents or your loved ones give you compliments.

18
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,800
When we receive compliments, we become very happy.

19
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:37,120
But that is not true happiness because that is just from the outside.

20
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:42,020
When people compliment you one day, they can give you ridicule the other day.

21
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,020
So it's not safe.

22
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:49,140
If you depend your happiness only on other people, then you'll never have inner peace.

23
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,520
When you get praised, stay calm like a mountain and don't be moved by it.

24
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,220
Other people do not define you.

25
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,700
You are perfect and complete.

26
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,860
As it is without other people's compliments.

27
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:01,860
So hear it.

28
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,860
That's good.

29
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,860
And keep going on with your life.

30
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:10,320
On the opposite, if people ridicule you, people blame you for things that you didn't do.

31
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,820
Your boss criticized you.

32
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,540
They give you negative comments.

33
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,540
What do you do?

34
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:20,840
Usually it will be upset right away, but that is not a good reaction of a meditator.

35
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,100
A meditator will know that this is just words.

36
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,600
People's words should not affect how you feel.

37
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,760
You are who you are as it is.

38
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,760
Your self-nature, like we said last time, it is naturally complete.

39
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,760
It's always complete.

40
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:42,080
No matter what other people say about you, you are still complete and perfect.

41
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,760
So know that for a fact and not be disturbed by any ridicule.

42
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,760
The third one is called fame.

43
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,540
Fame is when you have a good reputation.

44
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,400
You are well accepted by this society.

45
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,760
You might be great at your work.

46
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,760
You might be a great artist.

47
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:03,000
You might be a great singer, or you're famous in a certain area of your life, but if you

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,480
depend your happiness on your reputation, you can still be very depressed one day.

49
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,880
If people don't give you the recognition, you can be sad, like a lot of movie stars.

50
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,880
What happens to them?

51
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,880
Kill themselves.

52
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,920
If they don't receive the fame anymore or people look down on them, they can't take

53
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,920
it.

54
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,920
This is all because they don't have the strong meditative mind.

55
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,440
They don't have the inner peace in themselves.

56
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,000
Do not be happy about whatever reputation you have.

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,320
That's fine as it is, but you go on being happy and be with your self-nature without

58
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,680
being affected by your status and fame.

59
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,680
The fourth is the opposite.

60
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,880
Sometimes the society does not accept you.

61
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,880
You're a disgrace.

62
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,920
Nowadays we're all on the media, Facebook.

63
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,760
Sometimes you'll get negative comments.

64
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,760
A lot of kids.

65
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,760
Teenagers.

66
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,040
They really affected and all this peer pressure build up.

67
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,640
They want to come to suicide too.

68
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,520
That's all because they don't have the mind to know that they have the self-nature that

69
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,400
is perfect and complete.

70
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,320
You don't need other people's recognition to give you happiness.

71
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:21,280
Even in disgrace, you still are the perfect self-nature that's perfect and complete and

72
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,280
pure.

73
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,560
The fifth one is prosperity.

74
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,560
We might be prosperous.

75
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,000
You can have a great job, you can buy a big house, fancy car.

76
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,840
Things are going well, we tend to be very happy, but your happiness is dependent on

77
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,840
things going well.

78
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,840
But what if things don't go well?

79
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,840
What if there's decline?

80
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:50,560
Sickness, get a divorce, bankruptcy, lose your loved ones, everything happens.

81
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,560
Like happened to me.

82
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,560
My eyes went bad when I was in my 20s.

83
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,560
What would you do?

84
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,560
Right?

85
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,560
If you would have prosperity, you would have declines.

86
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,560
Everything is impermanent.

87
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
Nothing will last forever.

88
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:09,360
Know everything is dependent on cause and conditions and not be caught up with what's

89
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,040
happening to you because you have the perfect and complete self-nature.

90
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:20,640
It does not rise or perish dependent on how good or bad your environment or how great

91
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,640
your life is.

92
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,640
The seventh one is called pleasure.

93
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,560
Sometimes we depend on our happiness.

94
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,560
Our happiness on material goods.

95
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,560
You go traveling, you have great food, you go to the movie, or you have to drink coffee

96
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,560
to be happy.

97
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,560
That's pleasure.

98
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:43,560
That's fine, but if your happiness is solely dependent on material goods, then that's

99
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:50,560
very dangerous to you because you'll never be fully satisfied and it can become an addiction.

100
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,400
What if you don't need these things and you can still be happy?

101
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,400
You're always happy without any outside factors.

102
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,400
Isn't that better?

103
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
Okay, we call that enlightenment.

104
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:07,400
When you're truly enlightened, you don't need these material goods and you are perfect

105
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,400
as yourself.

106
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,400
So the last one is pain, the opposite of pleasure.

107
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:19,400
Sometimes you will be in sickness, sometimes you will be in great pain, a lot of suffering,

108
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,400
or you're materially very lacking, no money or no food.

109
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,400
It's true in a lot of things.

110
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,400
But like we said, our self-nature, everything is generated by your thoughts.

111
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,400
So if you have positive thoughts, you will create positive life and you will not be affected

112
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,400
by this pain.

113
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,400
If you stay positive when you're in pain, the pain will go away.

114
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,400
Know that your mind creates this whole universe.

115
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:53,400
Living in your true self-nature and not be affected by any positive or negative consequences.

116
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:58,400
So about a thousand years ago, there is a Chinese poet.

117
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,400
He's really good at meditating.

118
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
One day, he was meditating.

119
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:09,400
He thought he'd reached his full level of enlightenment and great samadhi, great concentration.

120
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,400
And then he wrote a poem.

121
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,400
He said, I bow to the god amongst the gods.

122
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,400
His hair light illuminates the world.

123
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,400
I'm moved by the avian's blow.

124
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,400
Upright, I sit in the purple dome.

125
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,400
Golden lotus.

126
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,400
He's bowing to all the Buddhas.

127
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:33,400
And because he's never affected by the avian's, he's sitting upright on the lotus flower.

128
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:38,400
He was so proud of himself, he sent this letter to his best friend, who is a monk.

129
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,400
That's across the river.

130
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
So he had someone carry the letter over.

131
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,400
And a few days later, he received the letter back.

132
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,400
And on the letter, it only has one word.

133
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,400
And the word, it says fart.

134
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,400
Which means utter nonsense.

135
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,400
And he became really upset.

136
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
He was moved.

137
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,400
So he didn't know he was moved.

138
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,400
He had to ride a boat and went across the river.

139
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,400
Because he felt really insulted that he has to talk to his friend.

140
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,400
And his friend, the monk, knew that he was coming.

141
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,400
His friend wasn't there.

142
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:21,400
But he rolled on the sand and said, I'm moved by the avian's wind, but blown across the river by a fart.

143
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:29,400
So that is just to show you, it's not easy to be unaffected by the avian's wind.

144
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,400
You have to be really a great cultivator.

145
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:39,400
And you really have to go into deep meditation for you to be fully in line with your true self nature.

146
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,400
But you keep meditating, meditating.

147
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:48,400
One day you will realize that you are really the true self nature that's perfect and pure and complete.

148
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,400
Without being affected by any outside circumstances.

149
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,400
So that's the class for today.

150
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,400
Thank you for listening.

151
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,400
Amitabha.

152
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,400
Amitabha.
