1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,680
Today we are going to talk about using suffering as our teacher.

2
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,680
Buddha taught the Four Noble Truths.

3
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,480
The First Noble Truth is understanding suffering.

4
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:31,060
If we can understand suffering, then we can end the suffering, reach Nirvana.

5
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:36,460
We will discuss ten different kinds of sufferings and learn how to use them as our spiritual

6
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,460
teacher.

7
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:42,500
Today we will discuss the first five and the next class will discuss the other five.

8
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,420
Number one, do not wish to be free from illness.

9
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,600
Our body is impermanent.

10
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,360
It's made out of impermanent components.

11
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,800
It's constantly changing.

12
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,180
Sickness is inevitable.

13
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,540
Suffering doesn't really come from being sick.

14
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:01,360
It comes mostly from our resistance to the sickness.

15
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,900
We don't want to be sick, don't accept sickness.

16
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:11,000
If we can understand impermanence and accept the sickness, then there will no longer be

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,580
a suffering.

18
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,960
Our ninth patriarch of the Pure Land Buddhism, O.E.

19
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,620
Master, he was enlightened when he was 24.

20
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,800
He wrote a lot of great commentaries and treaties.

21
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,860
When he was 56, he was severely sick for seven days.

22
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,180
He couldn't sit or lie down.

23
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:34,000
All he can do is chant Amitabha Buddha's name with tears in his eyes.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,120
That's when he realized no matter how enlightened he was, he had to rely on Amitabha Buddha and

25
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,040
go to the Western Pure Land.

26
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:49,160
So use our illness as medicine to cure our attachment to our body, to this world, and

27
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,160
have true renunciation.

28
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,160
And understand that true renunciation is the true renunciation.

29
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,160
And understand that true renunciation is the true renunciation.

30
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:57,780
Understand the true importance of going to the Western Pure Land that's without any suffering.

31
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:03,520
Number two, don't always aspire to be free from difficulties.

32
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,380
When life is smooth sailing, we're likely to be arrogant and have indolence.

33
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,580
I had a pretty good life growing up.

34
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,500
I was always the head of my class.

35
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,840
I was a valedictorian on my high school.

36
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:20,800
I went on to UC Berkeley, got a business degree, and I got a great job after graduation.

37
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,100
I was promoted very quickly.

38
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,720
Until one day, I couldn't see out of my eyes.

39
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:31,740
It's a rare retina degenerative disease that took most of my central vision.

40
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,880
So I couldn't go to work, I couldn't see the computer, I couldn't drive.

41
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,700
I was devastated.

42
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,880
But that's when I started putting all my time into learning Buddhism.

43
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,720
I just closed my eyes and listened to the Dharma.

44
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,860
That was the only way to cope with my tragedy.

45
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,860
Now it's been 18 years.

46
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,860
If it's not for my eyes, then I wouldn't devote myself to Buddhism.

47
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,860
I just closed my eyes and listened to the Dharma.

48
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,860
That was the only way to cope with my tragedy.

49
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,980
I don't want to devote my whole life to Buddhism.

50
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,100
So use our difficulties as a deliverance.

51
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,620
Deliver us from complacency.

52
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,560
Motivate us to practice diligently.

53
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,740
Number 3, ask not for easy realization when self-reflecting.

54
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,860
Buddhism is about the study of our own mind.

55
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,320
It's very complex to study our own mind.

56
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:20,480
Especially, we have a lot of depression, anxiety, and a lot of fear.

57
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,480
We need to use this focus.

58
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:27,960
this fear to really understand the dharma for the first years of my eye condition my eyes was

59
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:34,920
progressively getting worse so i developed strong depression i couldn't eat couldn't sleep i had

60
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:42,440
severe insomnia i was really depressed then i realized my depression did not come from not able

61
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:49,640
to see well it actually came from the fear of being completely blind what if i see pitch black

62
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:55,000
what will my life be like other people have to take care of me that would be horrible the more

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,640
i thought about it the more depressed i became until one day the dharma and the heart sutra

64
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:11,000
really hit me it says to realize the emptiness of the five skantas body feeling perception mental

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:19,320
formation and consciousness so i asked myself is this depression real is this feeling my is it the

66
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:28,120
real me then i realized it's all an illusion this is not me it's just my deluded mind conjuring up

67
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:34,840
this image in my head it's not real then i learned to shift on my focus i don't think about my eyes

68
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:41,400
anymore i just put all my energy into helping other people and to be of service to other how

69
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:48,360
people learn buddhism miraculously my eyes stopped getting worse i was genuinely happy and all my

70
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,560
depression went away

71
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:59,320
so use the complexity of our mind as liberation to liberate us from the deluded mind and to gain

72
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:07,880
wisdom about emptiness number four when cultivating there will be demonic obstacles mara which is

73
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:14,520
the sanskrit word for a demon he is not happy when someone is trying to get out the six rounds

74
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,560
of reincarnation when you're cultivating heart he will try to block you just like

75
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:27,000
in the shiragama sutra it talks about ananda's fall one day ananda was collecting alms through

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,440
the city in sequential order he passed by a house of prostitution this happened to be the house of

77
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:41,080
the daughter of matangi who's already madly in love with ananda for his good looks so when she

78
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:48,520
saw him she immediately went to her mom and begged her to do a love spell onto ananda so the mother

79
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:56,600
sent her mantra onto a cloth to cover up ananda's bowl when ananda removed the cloth he was

80
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:03,560
controlled by the spell he went up to her room lied in her bed and she started caressing him

81
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:10,040
that's when he was on the verge of losing his precept substance luckily he was able to call

82
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:17,560
out to buddha in his mind buddha sends ananda's trouble immediately sent manjushri bodhisattva to

83
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,840
rescue ananda

84
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:27,080
when manjushri bodhisattva arrived he immediately recited the shiragama mantra and broke the spell

85
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,520
then he brought back ananda and their daughter matangi back to buddha that's when buddha

86
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:39,960
expounded the great dharma of the shiragama sutra so if it's not for ananda's fall he will not be

87
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:46,920
enlightened he will not find his true nature and we will not have the shiragama sutra to learn from

88
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,400
so use the obstacles

89
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:57,560
ask our spiritual companions to find our true nature our pure mind number five do not hope for

90
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:04,760
goals to be easily achieved all successful people go through trials and tribulations

91
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:11,320
before their goals are achieved the key is not to dwell on the outcome the key is to enjoy the

92
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:17,800
process of learning to train our perseverance as long as we try our best and learn along the way

93
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,240
then it's already a success

94
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:30,440
desperado

95
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,260
super

96
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,060
so

97
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,400
there was a pig that was only born with two front legs without hind legs nobody thought he could

98
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:47,480
survive but the owner did not give up on him he kept trying to train him to walk on two legs when

99
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,000
feeding him he kept moving the feeding dish further and further away so the pig had to try to rock on

100
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,320
his front legs he fell many many many times but finally he was able to walk run and jump with his

101
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:49,360
front legs so as long as you hit a wall you may get water then you can perfume the tent and everyone over night will be happy

102
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:58,080
he became the inspirational mascot of the town so we want to use our adversities as a fulfillment

103
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:04,560
as long as we try our best and never give up and train our perseverance it's already a fulfillment

104
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:14,240
in itself in conclusion we say affliction is Bodhi our affliction and our suffering is the way to

105
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:20,960
become enlightened without them we will not have enlightenment so don't worry if you're having

106
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:29,040
sufferings right now all you have to do is to understand it accept it and use it use it to

107
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:37,600
develop true renunciation to motivate us to practice diligently to gain wisdom on emptiness

108
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:43,740
to find our true nature and to train our perseverance this is actually

109
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,020
a

110
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:44,220
suffering

111
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:49,220
a teaching from a treaty of a Pure Land recitation.

112
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,860
If we can really use our sufferings as teacher

113
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,760
in our daily lives on the brink of our death,

114
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,800
we'll no longer be afraid,

115
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,460
and we can really choose the Pure Land

116
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,760
as our final destination.

117
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,120
So that's the class for today.

118
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,160
Thank you for listening.

119
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,000
Amitabha.
