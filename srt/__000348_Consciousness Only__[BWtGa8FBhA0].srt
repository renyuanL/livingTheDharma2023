1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Today we are going to talk about Consciousness Only.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Everything is created by our mind alone.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We are going to look at the three kinds of states,

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
three modes of knowledge and three moral natures.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
First, let's look at our Eight Consciousness.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We have the Eye Consciousness,

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Ears Consciousness,

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Nose,

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Tongue,

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Body.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
These five experience the external world,

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
sight,

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
sound,

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
smell,

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
taste,

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and touch.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Then we have the Six Consciousness,

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
the Mind Consciousness,

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
that discriminate and have perception.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Then we have the Seventh Consciousness,

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
which is the Mindless Consciousness.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It perceives the Eight Consciousness as the Self.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Then we have the Laya Consciousness,

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
which is the big storehouse that stores all our karmic seeds.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
All Eight Consciousness can be aligned with these three kinds of states,

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
three modes of knowledge,

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and three moral natures.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Three kinds of states are the perceived objects of our mind.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The three modes of knowledge are the subject,

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
the thinking mind that perceives the objects.

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
First look at the three kinds of states.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The first state is Real State.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's the truthful state that is happening right now in front of us.

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
For example, our eyes,

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
sees,

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
ears,

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
hears,

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
nose,

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
smells,

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
tongue,

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
taste,

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and body,

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
touches.

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
All these at the very first instance.

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That is called the Real State.

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But this state is only the first instance

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
when you have no thoughts at all.

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
For example, you see a house.

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Before you even have the idea that this is a house,

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
before you give it a name,

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
that is called the Real State.

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
We hardly ever see this Real State.

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Once we start discriminating,

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
once we start thinking,

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
and give a name,

56
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
labeling,

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
give it stereotyping,

58
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
then it's called the Distorted State.

59
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So this state,

60
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
the Real State,

61
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
is no longer real.

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's now distorted.

63
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's transposed by our thoughts.

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Because our first five consciousness,

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
the second instance,

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
is already working together with the sixth consciousness

67
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
because they are in intimate connection with each other.

68
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The first five cannot really function by themselves.

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
They always have to work with the sixth consciousness.

70
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Therefore, the sixth consciousness grabs onto

71
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
the shadows of the first five consciousnesses

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
and it creates an image in its mind.

73
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So we only experience the Distorted State

74
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
in our sixth consciousness.

75
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
We never really see the Real State that is outside.

76
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So we're always living in a Distorted State

77
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
which has our own thinking,

78
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
our own perception.

79
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And this Distorted State includes our seventh consciousness.

80
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The seventh consciousness,

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
only cares about the eighth consciousness.

82
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It doesn't go outside to experience the world.

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It only takes the perceiver of the eighth consciousness

84
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
as the self.

85
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So its object is the image of the self.

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
But this is already a Distorted State.

87
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Number three,

88
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
we have the Imagined State.

89
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
This state is only imagined by our sixth consciousness.

90
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Even without the help of

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
the first five consciousnesses,

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
we don't have to experience the world.

93
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
We can be thinking all the time.

94
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
This includes our memory.

95
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's kind of like the Distorted State

96
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
but it's actually only an Imagined State

97
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
because nothing is in front of you.

98
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You can remember things from a long time ago.

99
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
For example,

100
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
a lot of people remember the childhood abuse

101
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
or someone who has done us wrong

102
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
and we remember it for our whole life.

103
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And it will give us anxiety,

104
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
fear,

105
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
or emotional burden.

106
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Most of us,

107
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
we only live in our Imagined State.

108
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Our mind is mostly negative in its thoughts.

109
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Imagined State includes our dreams,

110
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
hallucinating,

111
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
or daydreaming.

112
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
That's all Imagined State.

113
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
As you can see,

114
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
we want to be in the Real State.

115
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Enlightened beings are saying

116
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
they are usually in the Real State.

117
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
They're always right here, right now.

118
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Someone asked the Zen Master,

119
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
how do we know if we're enlightened?

120
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The Master said,

121
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
eat when you're hungry,

122
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
sleep when you're drowsy,

123
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
then you're enlightened.

124
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Most of us,

125
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
we cannot eat when we're hungry.

126
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
We always have to discriminate.

127
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
This food is good or bad.

128
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's too salty.

129
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's too sweet.

130
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's too bland.

131
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Keep giving opinions.

132
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You can never eat as it is.

133
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And we can't really fall asleep

134
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
when we go to bed

135
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
because we keep thinking.

136
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
A lot of us cannot accept

137
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
and work with the reality.

138
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
We lose our peace and equanimity.

139
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But a Zen Master or Enlightened Being,

140
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
they look like average person,

141
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
but their mind is always at peace

142
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
because they always live in the emptiness awareness.

143
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
They are not giving judgment about things.

144
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
They always live without vaccines.

145
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
They don't have any attachments.

146
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Now let's look at the three modes of knowledge.

147
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The subject,

148
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
the perceiver.

149
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Our perceiver can have three modes.

150
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The first mode is veridical,

151
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
which is the truth,

152
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
genuine,

153
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
the fact,

154
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
not illusory.

155
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So it always go with the real state.

156
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Veridical is the state we want to be in

157
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
when we are meditating.

158
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
That's right here and right now.

159
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
If we're having wandering thoughts,

160
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
then it's no longer the veridical state.

161
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
We want to bring ourselves to the breathing,

162
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
to the present moment,

163
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
to the name Amitabha.

164
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That's when we are right here and right now.

165
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You know who else is always in the state?

166
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Babies.

167
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So we should learn from babies.

168
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
When they're hungry, they eat.

169
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
When they are sleepy, they sleep.

170
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
They do not discriminate much

171
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
and they do not think too much.

172
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
That is actually

173
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
the best state of mind.

174
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
We have inference

175
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
when we are having assumptions

176
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
about situations

177
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
and we have logical thinking.

178
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
When we are analyzing,

179
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
when we're planning,

180
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
when we're studying,

181
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
that's the state of inference.

182
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
When we assume correctly,

183
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
it's called inference.

184
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
When we assume incorrectly,

185
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
it's called fallacy.

186
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's wrong.

187
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
For example,

188
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
the seventh consciousness,

189
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
thinking that the perceiver

190
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
of the eighth consciousness

191
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
is the self,

192
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
that is a fallacy

193
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
because there's no actual thing as self.

194
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The seventh consciousness

195
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
perceives incorrectly.

196
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's a false self.

197
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
We all live in this false self.

198
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That's why we are always living

199
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
in the mode of fallacy.

200
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
We experience the world

201
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
from the point of view of the self.

202
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The seventh consciousness

203
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
is always influencing

204
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
and telling the sixth consciousness

205
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
what to think.

206
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
All our emotion is based on

207
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
how tainted and polluted

208
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
our seventh consciousness is.

209
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So the distorted state

210
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
can be inference or fallacy.

211
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The imagined state

212
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
can be inference and fallacy

213
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
or veridical sometimes

214
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
when you're in meditation.

215
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
There is a Chinese fable

216
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
called

217
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Cup Bowl Snake Reflection.

218
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
There is a person

219
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
named Wen Gong.

220
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
He went to his friend's house.

221
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The friend gave him a cup of tea.

222
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
In the cup of tea,

223
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
all of a sudden,

224
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
he saw a little snake.

225
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
But he doesn't want to hurt

226
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
his friend's feelings,

227
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
so he drank the whole cup of tea.

228
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
After he went home,

229
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
he felt very sick.

230
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
A lot of doctors tried to heal him,

231
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
but nobody can help him.

232
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
The friend asked him

233
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
to come back to his house again.

234
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So he went back

235
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
and he sat in the same seat.

236
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
In the cup of tea,

237
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
there is a snake again.

238
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
He was scared,

239
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
and he told his friend,

240
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
oh my god,

241
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
there is a snake in my tea.

242
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
His friend said,

243
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
look,

244
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
there is actually

245
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
a bowl hanging on the wall

246
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
behind the chair.

247
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
The snake is only

248
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
the reflection of the bowl.

249
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Wen Gong felt very silly,

250
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
and he no longer felt sick.

251
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So his mind is taking

252
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
the distorted state,

253
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
and he is living

254
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
in the mode of fallacy.

255
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So this is a perfect example

256
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
of how our mind

257
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
affects our body.

258
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Whatever we think,

259
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
it will affect how we are.

260
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Be careful of our thoughts.

261
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
The subject and the object,

262
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
together,

263
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
we will have three kinds of thoughts.

264
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It's called the three moral natures.

265
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
We can have wholesome thoughts,

266
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
unwholesome thoughts,

267
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
and neutral thoughts.

268
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
The first five consciousnesses

269
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
can have all three natures,

270
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
wholesome, unwholesome,

271
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
or neutral.

272
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
The first five,

273
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
they have minimal ability

274
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
to have wholesome

275
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
or unwholesome thoughts.

276
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Mostly,

277
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
it's working together

278
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
with the sixth consciousness

279
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
that has these three modes.

280
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
The first five consciousnesses,

281
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
they are mostly in the neutral mode,

282
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
which is not wholesome

283
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
and not unwholesome.

284
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Wholesome means

285
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
we are benefiting others

286
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
now and in the future.

287
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Unwholesome means

288
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
we are harming others

289
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
now and in the future.

290
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Neutral means

291
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
it's not wholesome

292
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
and not unwholesome.

293
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
For example,

294
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
when we're bored,

295
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
we're not doing anything.

296
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
We're just standing there

297
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
or we're just daydreaming

298
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
or we're just sleeping.

299
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
But that is still

300
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
a kind of ignorance.

301
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You will still create

302
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
negative karma

303
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
because you're not doing things

304
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
to help yourself

305
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
being enlightened

306
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
or helping others

307
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
or doing good deeds.

308
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
We all have these three natures

309
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
of thoughts.

310
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
The key is

311
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
we want to know

312
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
what we are doing

313
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
and what we are not doing.

314
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So,

315
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
the first five consciousnesses,

316
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
we will have

317
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
these three natures

318
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
of thoughts.

319
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
The key is

320
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
we want to stay wholesome.

321
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
So anytime

322
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
when we're positive,

323
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
we're faithful,

324
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
we're cheerful,

325
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
we're grateful,

326
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
when we are unwholesome,

327
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
any negative emotion

328
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
when we're depressed,

329
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
we're stressed,

330
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
we're fearful,

331
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
we have anxiety,

332
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
bitter,

333
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
angry,

334
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
jealous,

335
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
that's all

336
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
unwholesome thoughts.

337
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Wholesome thoughts

338
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
will create

339
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
wholesome deeds

340
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
and wholesome karma.

341
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Unwholesome thoughts

342
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
will create

343
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
unwholesome deeds

344
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
and unwholesome karma.

345
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So,

346
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
every thought

347
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
has effect.

348
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
All these,

349
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
they are collected

350
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
in the

351
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Alaya consciousness

352
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
as karmic seeds.

353
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
When the conditions ripen,

354
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
they ripen

355
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
into results,

356
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
into the world

357
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
that we experience.

358
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So,

359
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
all the outside world

360
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
is created

361
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
by our

362
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Alaya consciousness.

363
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
This is a big cycle

364
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
of reincarnation.

365
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Everything is created

366
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
by our mind

367
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
and everything

368
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
is experienced

369
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
by our mind.

370
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Nothing is really

371
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
outside of our mind.

372
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
That's why

373
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
it's called

374
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
consciousness only.

375
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So,

376
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
realize

377
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
that

378
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
all

379
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
the consciousness

380
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
are empty

381
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
in nature.

382
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
They are

383
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
the deluded mind.

384
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
This is not

385
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
our original self.

386
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
We are

387
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
actually

388
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
the enlightened

389
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
mind

390
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
that is

391
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
without

392
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
the A consciousness.

393
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
All the A consciousness

394
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
are

395
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
purified

396
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
into wisdom

397
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
and we

398
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
are empty

399
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
in nature.

400
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
That's our

401
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
true suchness.

402
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
We want to

403
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
bring ourselves

404
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
to the state

405
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
of true

406
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
veridical

407
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
and real state.

408
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Even all these

409
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
are empty

410
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
in nature.

411
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You want to

412
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
bring back

413
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
the state

414
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
of true emptiness.

415
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
That is

416
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Nirvana

417
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
or

418
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
enlightenment.

419
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That's the class for today.

420
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Thank you for listening.

421
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Amitabha.
