1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Today we are going to talk about the Ten Vows of Universal Worthy Bodhisattva.

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This is the last lesson.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The last three is number eight, nine, and ten.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And today we are going to complete the Ten Vows.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The eighth one is to always follow the teachings of Buddha.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We want to always follow Buddha's teachings so you don't forget how to be a Buddha.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We learn Buddhism, we cultivate, so we can all become Buddhas.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
How do you become Buddha? You gotta always follow the teachings.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
There are six ways you should always watch yourself.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Do I look like a Buddha?

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, talking, working.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Do I act like a Buddha? Am I being a Buddha?

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Always check yourself. This is a meditation in itself.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Every time we're walking, you ask yourself three things.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
First, am I doing good deeds or bad deeds by walking?

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Am I walking to help someone or am I walking to hit someone?

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What am I doing?

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So first, ask yourself, is it moral what I'm doing?

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And second, ask yourself, is this walking in line with my deep concentration?

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Step by step, can I feel my feet on the ground and I'm being calm and stable just like I'm meditating?

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Third, ask yourself, is this walking in line with my wisdom?

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Do I have the wisdom of knowing it's not just me walking?

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I am walking.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I am walking like a Buddha with my own Buddha nature inside.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So walking, is it a cultivation?

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yes.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Walking is a cultivation.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Standing, you ask yourself the same three questions.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Am I standing to do a good deed or is this a bad deed?

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Is it in line with my calmness and my meditation practice?

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Am I standing upright and doing it like a Buddha?

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And third,

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Do I have the wisdom of Buddha when I'm standing here?

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I am as a spiritual person, as a Buddha.

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:36,000
No matter if you're walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, talking, working, you want to be like a Buddha.

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So learning the Buddha's way.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's very important that we get close to virtuous people.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
If you don't listen to the teaching all the time, you will go back to your old ways and you'll lose your good practice.

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
For all mundane people, it's really hard for us to keep aware of what we're doing.

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Human beings are very influenced by our environment.

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So we need to get close to good people.

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
There's a story about this elephant.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
This elephant is very, very big and very belligerent.

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Whenever he sees a person, he just stumps on the person and kills the person.

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So the king uses this elephant as a weapon

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
to kill all the criminals and enemies.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
One time, the place the elephant was staying was burned.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So they moved the elephant to another location.

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
This location happened to be next to a temple.

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The elephant listened to the monks chanting every day.

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
After a while, every time he sees people, he just uses his trunk and smiles at them.

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He doesn't stomp on them anymore.

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Because why?

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He's been next to the temple.

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So the king found out.

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
We can't have an elephant coming like that.

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So they moved the elephant next to the slaughterhouse.

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The elephant listened to the butcher and slaughtered the animals every day.

59
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Sure enough, he became belligerent again.

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And he starts stumping on people again.

61
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So we are very influenced by our environment.

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
If you don't have good people to get close to,

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
listen to the Dharma, to the teachings all the time.

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So you'll acquire what the Buddha likes

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
and change our way for the better.

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That is the main reason we want to go to the Western Pure Land.

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Because Amitabha Buddha built this world for us,

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
the perfect school to cultivate into Buddhahood.

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Nobody over there is a bad influence.

70
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Everybody is a Bodhisattva.

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Everybody wants you to become a Buddha.

72
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That's why we vow to go to the Western Pure Land of Amitabha.

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So that's the first one, to always follow the teachings of Buddha.

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Second,

75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
to be always in harmony with all beings.

76
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
A Bodhisattva is always in harmony with everyone.

77
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Why are we in disharmony with people?

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Because we don't like people that are different.

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
We have conflicts because they are different.

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We don't like them or we judge them or we discriminate.

81
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
But that's not a Bodhisattva's way.

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
A Bodhisattva is always in harmony with everybody.

83
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Because why?

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
He wants to help everyone.

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
A Bodhisattva is someone that always helps others.

86
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
We not only go out of our way to help them.

87
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It says in the sutra,

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Buddha vows to help the sick, the lost, the depressed, the poor.

89
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
In his heart, he wants to be a good doctor to the ones that are sick.

90
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What does that mean?

91
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
When someone is sick in their mind,

92
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
for example, we have our defilement,

93
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
we're greedy, we're angry, we're ignorant.

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That's our sickness.

95
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
A Bodhisattva will try to help the sick get rid of their defilement.

96
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And we want to help the lost find their way.

97
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Sometimes we lose our moral judgment and our values

98
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
and we do things that are immoral.

99
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The Bodhisattva will try to help so you will no longer be lost

100
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
and find the right path.

101
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And whenever someone is depressed,

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
a Bodhisattva will give them light and help them be confident,

103
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
be by their side and make them feel better about themselves

104
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
so they will be happy.

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And whenever someone is poor,

106
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
we want to help them find the treasure inside of them.

107
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Everyone is a Buddha.

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Nobody should be poor.

109
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
If you believe in yourself,

110
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
then you can make millions of dollars and just believe in yourself.

111
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
We all have the Buddha nature.

112
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
We should all believe in ourselves.

113
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So a Bodhisattva will help people to believe in themselves

114
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
and to become rich and have abundance.

115
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So always try to help others and be in harmony

116
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
with all beings.

117
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So that's number nine.

118
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Lastly, a Bodhisattva learns to dedicate all merits.

119
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
All ten bells, there's merits.

120
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
From the first one to the ninth,

121
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
everything that you do here,

122
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
accumulate great merits.

123
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Whenever we have merits,

124
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
we dedicate this to everybody else.

125
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's like earning interest.

126
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Tenfold, a hundredfold, a thousandfold.

127
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
If you keep dedicating the merit,

128
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
you will not lose it.

129
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You will not lose anything for yourself.

130
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You will make it bigger and bigger

131
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
and keep growing to this huge infinite merit.

132
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So how do we dedicate the merit?

133
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
First, we dedicate to all beings.

134
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
That means dedicating from the self to others.

135
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Not just for ourselves.

136
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
We want to give it to everyone else.

137
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
From the self to others.

138
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Help others gain happiness,

139
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
gain wisdom,

140
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
because of our merit of chanting,

141
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
of helping others,

142
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
if we dedicate and pray for them,

143
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
they will really receive the merit.

144
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So dedicate to all beings.

145
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Second, dedicate to Bodhi.

146
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Bodhi means becoming Buddhahood.

147
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So every merit is a cause.

148
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
We want to give this cause

149
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and dedicate it to the effect.

150
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What's the effect?

151
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's becoming a Buddha.

152
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Reach Buddhahood.

153
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So no matter what kind of goodness

154
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
you dedicate this merit to becoming

155
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
and reach enlightenment and Buddhahood.

156
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That's our ultimate effect.

157
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Third, we want to dedicate our merit

158
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
to true suchness.

159
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
This means our own Buddha nature.

160
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
That's the true suchness of all things.

161
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Suchness means it is what it is.

162
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's the true Buddha nature.

163
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
That is the only thing that really really exists

164
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
in this entire world.

165
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's your own self nature.

166
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
No matter what kind of good deed

167
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
you dedicate so you can open up

168
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
your own true self nature.

169
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
We dedicate all the phenomenon

170
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
to inner truth.

171
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Phenomenon is the actual event

172
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
or activity or the good deed.

173
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You want to dedicate this actual physical event

174
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
to the inner truth

175
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
which means our own Buddha nature.

176
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So no matter

177
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
what a little thing you do.

178
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Maybe today you just smiled at someone.

179
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
This little physical phenomenon

180
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
of smiling at someone,

181
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
you dedicate this to your own Buddha nature.

182
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's not just me smiling at someone.

183
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's me and my Buddha spirit,

184
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
my inner true spirit

185
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
smiling at this person.

186
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Then this merit will be gazillionfolds

187
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
because you understand the truth about life

188
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
which is called the inner truth

189
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
or we call it true suchness.

190
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
That's the essence of bodhisattva

191
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
universal worthy.

192
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
If everybody vow to become

193
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
like worthy bodhisattva

194
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
we can all make this world

195
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
a better place and everyone

196
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
will become a great bodhisattva.

197
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So thank you for listening.
