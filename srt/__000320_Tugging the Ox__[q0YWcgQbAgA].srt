00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,440
Today's topic is Tugging the Ox.

2
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:22,560
There are ten stages of enlightenment depicted by the ten ox-herding pictures of Zen.

3
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,560
Enlightenment is a process of freeing ourselves from the unenlightened states.

4
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,200
There are actually nine aspects of the unenlightened states.

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,200
Number one is activity of ignorance.

6
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,600
We were the suchness, but our mind started moving, become agitated,

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,880
it started to become the alaya consciousness, the storehouse of our karma.

8
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,380
So that's the activity of ignorance.

9
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,680
Then we would create the perceiving subject, the thinking mind,

10
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:56,720
and then we create the world of objects, the things that we think about, images in our mind.

11
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:05,600
So everything outside of us are actually all created by our alaya consciousness in the form of world of objects.

12
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,600
So these three are the subtle aspects of our deluded mind.

13
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,640
Then we have six crude aspects.

14
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,740
Number four is discriminating intellect.

15
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,240
Discriminate the world of objects.

16
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,620
This is what we like and what I do not like, and you keep having judgments and thoughts.

17
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,720
Then we will have aspects of continuity.

18
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,420
Discriminating thoughts will continue.

19
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:34,920
If you go to sleep and the moment you wake up, you have the same kinds of thoughts over and over.

20
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,200
Number six is our attachment.

21
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,700
When these thoughts keep continuing, it becomes our belief system.

22
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:48,240
We are extremely attached to the idea of the self and all the worldly things that we experience

23
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,340
based on the seventh consciousness, our ego.

24
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,440
Then we have speculation, our names and letters.

25
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,240
We think in terms of words.

26
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:02,740
In our mind, these words become our belief system and it becomes what we experience in life.

27
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,420
Because of our belief system, we will create karma.

28
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,760
Then we will have suffering based on the karma.

29
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:14,120
So these are the nine aspects of our deluded mind.

30
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:21,240
Now we are going to look at the ten stages of enlightenment compared to the nine aspects of non-enlightenment.

31
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,940
Number one, searching for the ox.

32
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,940
The shepherd boy fell asleep.

33
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,180
He lost his ox.

34
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,440
Along in the wilderness, he searches in despair.

35
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:38,360
The shepherd boy symbolizes the practitioner and the ox symbolizes our true nature.

36
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,940
Because of the suffering we are experiencing right now, it motivates us to search for our

37
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,980
spiritual self.

38
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,180
Number two is seeing the traces.

39
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:55,060
Along by the stream and under the tree scatter our traces of the lost ox.

40
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:55,940
Now we see something.

41
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:56,940
Some traces.

42
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:03,820
This symbolizes learning Buddhism, understanding the sutra and the dharma and help us to see

43
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,680
our true nature.

44
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:13,380
We are now changing our karmic deeds to align ourselves with our true nature and not follow

45
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,980
our defilement anymore.

46
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,540
Number three is seeing the ox.

47
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:25,180
This is depicted by a knight in a gown cheerfully singing on the bank, the willows are green,

48
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,520
the ox is there all by himself.

49
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:33,860
This is when we have epiphany, we saw a glimpse of our true nature.

50
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:40,020
A spiritual teacher, Dr. Wing Dyer, talked about how he had a shift in his consciousness.

51
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:45,600
When he was very young, his father left him, so he grew up in a series of orphanages.

52
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:52,940
In his adulthood, he was having a problem with alcohol and his marriage, so all because

53
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,180
of his resentment toward his father.

54
00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:02,140
Finally, in his mid-thirties, he decided to go look for his father's grave as his father

55
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,300
has already passed away for ten years.

56
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,860
When he was there, there was a strong feeling that came over him.

57
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:16,420
Finally, he released all his hatred toward his father, and from that day on, he only

58
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,740
had love in his heart.

59
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,760
There is no more hatred consuming him.

60
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,300
He transformed his life completely.

61
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:23,600
And he was able to see his true nature.

62
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:35,040
This is when we have epiphany and seeing the ox, that's when we let go of our speculations

63
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:41,820
of names and letters, let go the strong attachment of the labels in our heart.

64
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,640
Number four is catching the ox.

65
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:50,720
The ox is hard to keep under control because we have strong attachment to the self.

66
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,300
The mind is very stubborn.

67
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,960
You have epiphanies.

68
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,620
It can still go back to the same way because of the strong attachment.

69
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,020
Now the attachment has been softened.

70
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,560
Number five, hurting the ox.

71
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,180
We still have work to do.

72
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:14,380
The shepherd still need to hurt the ox with whips and tether so the animal does not wander

73
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:19,180
away again because we have strong aspect of continuity.

74
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,300
The old negative thought pattern can still keep going.

75
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,300
The old negative thought pattern can still keep going.

76
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,300
The old negative thought pattern can still keep going.

77
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,300
The old negative thought pattern can still keep going.

78
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,300
The old negative thought pattern can still keep going.

79
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,460
If you look at a husband and wife, usually they fight over the same thing years after

80
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,460
years.

81
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,460
Why?

82
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,460
Because they didn't change their thought pattern.

83
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:38,180
Changing the ox, whenever a situation arise, we are now at least aware of it and we can

84
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,180
break the pattern.

85
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,240
We can stop it from continuing.

86
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,240
Number six, coming home on the ox's back.

87
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,540
Riding on the ox, he leisurely wins his way home.

88
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,360
He is filled with joy indescribable.

89
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,360
The strong attachment to the ox is very important.

90
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,300
The strong attachment to the ox is very important.

91
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,300
The strong attachment to the ox is very important.

92
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,200
A burden is overcome is over because the discriminating intellect has dissolved.

93
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:04,860
So we are no longer discriminating and judging the world with our ego.

94
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,180
Now we have found our true self and everything is under control.

95
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,220
So we feel this incredible satisfaction in our heart.

96
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:17,460
We are no longer dependent on outside situations to make us happy.

97
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,460
We are always at home and at peace.

98
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,460
Welcome back.

99
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:27,920
that we never felt before. We finally feel a sense of ultimate happiness.

100
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:35,640
Number seven, two ox forgotten leaving the man alone. Now we have arrived home. We don't need

101
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:44,300
the ox anymore. The boy alone sits serenely at home because we have let go of the world of

102
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:52,300
object. The world of object does not bother this person at all because he knows everything is a

103
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:59,520
dream, an illusion. The world of object does not affect him in any way. He has found his true

104
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:07,380
nature, even letting go of finding enlightenment. When you're trying to search for an enlightenment

105
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:14,160
or a Buddha, it's like trying to grab space. You cannot grab space. The truth is there's nothing

106
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:21,800
to find because you're already there. Number eight, the ox and the man both gone out of sight.

107
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,280
The ox and the man both gone out of sight. The ox and the man both gone out of sight.

108
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:30,740
The ox is the world of object. The man symbolizes the perceiving subject. Both the subject and the

109
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:38,320
object, they are still duality. We have to let it go. We have to let go of all dualism in order

110
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:46,300
to reach who we really are, the true suchness. Whatever you do, wherever you are, that is your

111
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:52,260
real mind. That is the real Buddha. So we don't search for anything, look anywhere,

112
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:57,740
anywhere else. The mind is the Buddha. The mind is Nirvana. There's nothing to search.

113
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:03,520
You don't want your mind to take any form. When you are still enthralled with the form

114
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:10,300
of a subject, object, you are still not free. So do not let your mind take form because

115
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:17,440
when it has no form, it's spacious and without any limitations. Number nine, return to the

116
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,780
origin, back to the source. Now the activity of ignorance, ignorance, ignorance, ignorance,

117
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:29,740
ignorance, the alaya consciousness is completely turned into purity. Now it's a great perfect

118
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:36,520
mirror wisdom. This mirror revives clearly without any attachment to anything. Everything

119
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:43,360
sees clearly, but there's no attachment to any form. That is when we are the Buddha.

120
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:50,840
The mind is the Buddha. The Buddha is the mind. Number 10, entering the city with bliss bestowing

121
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,780
hands.

122
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:58,900
Now we are like a bodhisattva with a golden arm reaching out to all suffering beings.

123
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:05,600
After enlightenment, there's nothing to do but go back to your everyday life. Be a bodhisattva

124
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:12,740
to all the people that are not yet enlightened. You want to help everyone to be out of their

125
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:21,180
suffering and reach enlightenment. Our arm is like Amitabha reaching out to help all sentient

126
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:21,780
beings.

127
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:29,760
So we can actually create miracles in our lives. There is mom. Her boy has autism so

128
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,700
he is always screaming. She has to work during the day and at night. It takes a lot out of

129
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:41,660
her to take care of him. She can't help but complain about why it just happened to me.

130
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:47,720
I don't think I can take this anymore. It's just a constant struggle. One day she started

131
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,600
learning about the power of our own mind.

132
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,600
But what's the meaning of spiritual awareness? How does that work? How does it work? How does

133
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
that work? How does it work? How does that work? How does that work? How does it work? How does

134
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:59,920
she was looking at her boy finally she found peace she completely accepted for who he is

135
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:08,800
there's only unconditional love and she only sees beauty in him because of the way she has changed

136
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:18,160
her consciousness the boy miraculously became calm and normal so we can all make miracles in

137
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:26,560
our lives because our mind is the buddha all we have to do is to come back to who we really are

138
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:33,280
we never finish with the journey of enlightenment and we will never get it wrong there's no

139
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:40,160
definite answer to any of these this is just a way to bring ourselves to awakening

140
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:47,840
then you will be able to really understand what is nirvana what is the ultimate world of

141
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,160
happiness

142
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:54,640
of the Western Pure Land. So that is the class for today. Thank you for listening. Amitabha.
