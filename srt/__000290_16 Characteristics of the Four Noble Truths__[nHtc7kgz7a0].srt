1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Today we are going to talk about 16 characteristics of the Four Noble Truths.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
How do we meditate on the Four Noble Truths?

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
There are actually 4 characteristics under each Noble Truth for a total of 16.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
As we meditate on these 16 characteristics, we can become enlightened.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The first two Noble Truths are suffering and the causes of suffering.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
That's describing the difficult lives of mundane people in samsara.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Then we have cessation of suffering and the path to end suffering.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That's describing the happy lives of saints in nirvana.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We can all reach the cessation of suffering and be free from suffering.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Now let's look at suffering, the first Noble Truth.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The first characteristic of suffering is impermanence.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Everything arises due to causes and conditions that are forever changing.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Nothing remains the same even for a single moment.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But we expect permanence.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That's why impermanence is such a suffering.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
For the past week, so many people got COVID.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's unprecedented.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We really feel that impermanence is about life.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
In the Sutra of 42 Chapters, Buddha asked the Buddha,

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
How do you measure the length of a man's life?

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The monk replied, Five days.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Buddha said, You do not understand the way.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Then Buddha asked another monk,

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
How do you measure the length of a man's life?

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The monk answered, By the time that passes during a meal.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Buddha said, You do not understand the way.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Buddha asked a third time.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
This time, a monk replied, By the breath.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Buddha said, Very well, you know the way.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So our life is impermanent.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's in between breath.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
One breath that doesn't come, it's dead.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And it's next lifetime.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So understanding impermanence will allow us to accept it.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Every moment that we're living,

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
we will be diligent and mindful all the time,

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and not live in vain.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Now let's look at the second characteristic, which is suffering.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
There are three kinds of suffering.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The first suffering is called suffering of suffering.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This is the blatant suffering,

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
such as sickness.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The second suffering is suffering of changes.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
When the happiness decay, we lose the happiness.

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It becomes a big suffering.

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The third suffering is all-pervasive suffering.

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That's the moment-to-moment impermanence of our mind.

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Our mind has non-stop chattering,

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
and it has anxiety and insecurity in the background of our mind.

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
That is called all-pervasive suffering.

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We might be able to recognize the first suffering,

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
or even the second suffering,

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
but the all-pervasive suffering is really hard to recognize.

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
When we really recognize our suffering,

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
that's the door to enlightenment.

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So suffering is really our teacher.

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Number three, emptiness.

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Our biggest delusion is not understanding impermanence,

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
thinking there is a permanent, independent, controlling self.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And all our suffering comes from the attachment to the self,

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
the five aggregates.

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But the truth is that the five aggregates are just a combination

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
of physical and mental phenomena that's forever changing.

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Because all phenomena are just creations of our own alaya consciousness.

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So it's like a dream, a mirage, a bubble, and a flash of lightning.

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That's why we call emptiness, emptiness of the self.

67
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
If we understand this,

68
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
we will remove the ego-centered life experience

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
and be liberated from the presence of selfishness,

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
our true suffering.

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Number four is non-self.

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The five aggregates is condition arising,

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
therefore there is not intrinsic essence.

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
For example, if I have really low self-esteem

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
because growing up the condition is I have always been criticized,

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
or I have really high self-esteem

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
because growing up the condition is I have always been praised,

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
both the high self-esteem and the low self-esteem,

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
that's because of our ego.

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
We think there is a self that's independent from others.

81
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
We erect walls and we build turfs and territories for ourselves.

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
When we understand non-self,

83
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
it's realizing that the self and the others are not two.

84
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
When the line that divides up the self and the other is erased,

85
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
then there's no longer any conflict.

86
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
There's no longer anything to fear or gain for the self.

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So that is non-self.

88
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
When we have profound insight into these four characteristics,

89
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
that's when we understand our suffering.

90
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Number two, causes of suffering.

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The first characteristic is causes.

92
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The fundamental causes of our suffering

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
is our attachment to the self,

94
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
which gives rise to mental afflictions, karmic deeds,

95
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
and produces suffering.

96
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
For example, our mental afflictions of greed, anger, and ignorance

97
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
can produce karmic deeds such as killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct,

98
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
which produce the hell realm, the hungry ghost realm, and the animal realm.

99
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
This is all because of causation.

100
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And it also causes strong production,

101
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
our mental afflictions,

102
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
and karmic deeds

103
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
can immediately produce intense pain,

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
just like if we touch an open wound on the body,

105
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
it really hurts.

106
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So there's no god punishing us,

107
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
or bad luck,

108
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
or the wrongdoing of others.

109
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's all the karmic seeds in our laya consciousness

110
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
that's manifesting the sufferings.

111
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
That's why it's also called the origin,

112
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
like crops growing from a field.

113
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
All suffering originates

114
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
from our mental afflictions and karmic deeds.

115
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
The only way to reduce our suffering

116
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
is to abandon our evil deeds

117
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
and mental afflictions

118
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
and cultivate goodness.

119
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
According to Buddha,

120
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
anytime we suffer misfortune,

121
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
it's like being struck by an arrow.

122
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Oftentimes, we create the second arrow

123
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
by reacting negatively to the bad event.

124
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Then we react again to that negative emotion.

125
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The third, fourth, fifth arrow

126
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
starts raining down on us.

127
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So instead of pulling out the first arrow,

128
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
we actually create more arrows for ourselves.

129
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
By understanding the origins of our suffering,

130
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
we can stop shooting arrows at ourselves.

131
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Number four is conditioned.

132
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Our mental afflictions and karmic deeds

133
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
are both the main causes

134
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and the supporting conditions for our suffering.

135
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Just like crops,

136
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
it needs supporting conditions

137
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
such as water and fertilizer

138
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
in order for it to continue to grow.

139
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
If we do not want the crop of suffering,

140
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
we need to change our conditions

141
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
from mental afflictions

142
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
to wisdom of emptiness.

143
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So that's the causes.

144
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The third noble truth,

145
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
cessation of suffering.

146
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The first characteristic

147
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
is cessation.

148
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
We want to stop all our mental afflictions.

149
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
That's when we have true happiness

150
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
we call nirvana.

151
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
There was a boy

152
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
who renounced the luxuries of life

153
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
went up to the snow-covered mountain

154
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
and indulged into deep meditation.

155
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
While meditating one day,

156
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
he heard a voice

157
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
in which a man was reciting the verse,

158
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
All is changeable.

159
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Nothing is constant.

160
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
This is the law of birth and death.

161
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Hearing the voice,

162
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
the boy opened his eyes

163
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
and saw a ferocious-looking demon.

164
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
The boy asked him

165
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
to complete the verse

166
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
that was only partially recited.

167
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But the demon said,

168
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm too hungry to recite.

169
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The boy then readily offered himself

170
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
to be sacrificed as his food

171
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
if the demon agreed

172
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
to recite the remaining verse.

173
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Then the demon recited,

174
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Escaping the maelstrom of birth and death.

175
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
One attains the joy of nirvana.

176
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Hearing the complete verse,

177
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
the boy was overjoyed

178
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
as he had accomplished

179
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
the true meaning of his life.

180
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
He then recited and memorized the verse,

181
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
engraved it on stones,

182
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
cliffs, and trees.

183
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Then to keep his promise,

184
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
he climbed a tall tree,

185
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
took a plunge into the demon's mouth.

186
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Then the demon turned into Lord Chakra,

187
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
the guardian of heaven,

188
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
and stopped the boy from falling.

189
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Because he was only testing him

190
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
of his devotion and dedication to the Dharma.

191
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Of course, this boy is Shakyamuni Buddha.

192
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
He was willing to sacrifice his life

193
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
for the Dharma, for enlightenment.

194
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
This verse is talking about

195
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
what's going on here,

196
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
the Four Noble Truths.

197
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Everything is changeable.

198
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
That's talking about impermanence and emptiness.

199
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
We can escape the maelstrom of life and death.

200
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
That's when we have cessation of suffering.

201
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
When you have the non-self,

202
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
like the boy who was willing

203
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
to sacrifice himself for the Dharma,

204
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
you will reach enlightenment

205
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
and become a true bodhisattva.

206
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The second characteristic is

207
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
pacification.

208
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
We have true peace

209
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
when we have no more mental afflictions.

210
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
When we are greedy for worldly happiness,

211
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
we are not at peace.

212
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
When we are angry at worldly issues,

213
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
at worldly events,

214
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
we are also not at peace.

215
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So anytime we have mental afflictions,

216
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
we are burning with restlessness.

217
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So to have true peace

218
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
is when we have no more afflictive emotions.

219
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Number three is being superb.

220
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
We are being superb

221
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
when we are non-self.

222
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And that's when we have real compassion

223
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
and balanced wisdom.

224
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
We are perfectly pure and complete.

225
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
This is actually

226
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
our natural state,

227
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
our Buddha nature,

228
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
according to the Mahayana teaching.

229
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So our natural state

230
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
is not to have any afflictions.

231
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
We are supposed to be in nirvana.

232
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
We are supposed to be superb.

233
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Number four is definite emergence.

234
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
That's the true stopping of samsara.

235
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
This is at least at the stage

236
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
of the first level of our headship.

237
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
When the delusion of the view of self

238
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
is completely eradicated,

239
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
that's when we guarantee to be liberated

240
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
from the bondage of samsara.

241
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Now let's look at the path to end suffering.

242
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Number one is path.

243
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Path is the means which we progress,

244
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
leading us to cessation,

245
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
like a road that takes us

246
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
to the desired destination.

247
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
The Buddha's path will not be apart

248
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
from precept, concentration, and wisdom.

249
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
For example,

250
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
when we recite the name Amitabha,

251
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
it is a true precept.

252
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
When we refrain ourselves

253
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
from speaking bad words,

254
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
having bad thoughts,

255
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
doing bad deeds,

256
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
it is also training us for concentration.

257
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
When we keep repeating the Buddha's name,

258
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
we are training our deep concentration.

259
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And it's also wisdom.

260
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
The name itself means non-self.

261
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
That's why Amitabha is called

262
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
infinite light and infinite wisdom.

263
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Chanting Amitabha

264
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
is a perfect path to nirvana.

265
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Number two is awareness.

266
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
We should be mindful

267
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
of the depth of our problem,

268
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
which is suffering,

269
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
and the means to escape,

270
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
which is the path to end suffering.

271
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
When you are really aware,

272
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
you will not look at the world

273
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
from the perspective of the small self again.

274
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You will see everything

275
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
as cause and condition

276
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
and as emptiness.

277
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Number three is achievement.

278
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
We want to have this resultant state,

279
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
achieve what Buddha achieved.

280
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Buddha cultivated wisdom and merits.

281
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
That's why he achieved liberation.

282
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Number four is deliverance.

283
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
To be liberated from the bondage

284
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
of conditioned existence.

285
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
As you can see,

286
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
all 16 of these,

287
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
they work together hand in hand

288
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
and are interrelated.

289
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
For example,

290
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
if you want to be aware,

291
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
you need to contemplate

292
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
on impermanence and emptiness.

293
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
If you want to have pacification,

294
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
you need to know the causes and the origins,

295
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
which is our own mental afflictions.

296
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
This is all aligning ourselves

297
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
with the Pure Land Buddhism.

298
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Renounce the Saha world of suffering

299
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
and to joyously seeking the Pure Land

300
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
that is nirvana.

301
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
So have unwavered understanding

302
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
of the Four Noble Truths.

303
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Take refuge in it.

304
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
This is not a religious faith

305
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
or a text for us to study.

306
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
This is really our life right now.

307
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Shakyamuni Buddha,

308
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
he wanted to find a way

309
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
to end the suffering of birth,

310
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
aging, sickness and death.

311
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
This is what he realized.

312
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
This is the perfect time

313
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
for all of us to understand

314
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
our suffering and the Four Noble Truths

315
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
and have a breakthrough

316
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
in our cultivation.

317
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
That's the class for today.

318
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Thank you for listening.

319
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Amitabha.
