1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,360
Today we are going to talk about 14 chapters of Buddhism, chapter 1 meaning of Buddha, chart B and C.

2
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:27,760
Last time we learned Buddha is someone who eradicated two obstacles and reached wisdom and enlightenment.

3
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,880
Today we will further discuss the two obstacles.

4
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:39,280
Hopefully we will understand that these two obstacles are basically all our life problems and we can resolve them by practicing Buddhism.

5
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,600
Now let's look at the two obstacles.

6
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:48,560
We have the obstacle of affliction which is about our lives and we have obstacle of knowledge which is about our world.

7
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,680
Let's first look at our life, our life outlook.

8
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,760
How do we see our life right now?

9
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,680
Do we know that our personal affliction is the cause of all our problems?

10
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,720
Let's look at our current experiences.

11
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,760
Right now we are experiencing a lot of sufferings.

12
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,360
We have 8 kinds of sufferings.

13
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:18,640
We have suffering of birth, aging, sickness and death, separation from our loved ones, being together with people we dislike and not obtaining what we desire and the imbalance of our body and mind.

14
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,000
These 8 sufferings all of us have to go through them.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,840
So life is very unsatisfactory and unstable.

16
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:40,400
A lot of times we feel we are freedomless, we are trapped in this cycle and we have no control over when we are going to get sick or we are going to die and we have no control over our own emotion most of the time.

17
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,760
A lot of times we also feel inequality.

18
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:52,960
Some people are rich, some people are poor, some people are healthy, some are handicapped and the level of our intelligence is all different.

19
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,000
Why is that?

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,680
This is all because of our culture.

21
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,240
This is all because of our karma or causation.

22
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,520
It's what we have done before, that's what we are experiencing our life right now.

23
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,920
We do a lot of bad deeds, that's why we have negative karma most of the time that becomes suffering.

24
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:18,240
In the sutra it says, even though a hundred thousand kalpas pass, a karma which is created does not perish.

25
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:25,600
When the cause and the conditions come together, retribution will still be personally undergone.

26
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:32,320
Everything that we do, every thought we think, actually has effect, has consequences.

27
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,640
So let's look at our present action.

28
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,240
What we do right now, creates our future.

29
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,560
A lot of times we are creating cause of suffering which are afflictions.

30
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,520
Are greed, anger and ignorance.

31
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,280
for example if we are greedy, we steal someones things.

32
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,720
Then in the future, someone will steal our things.

33
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,000
You could kill your loved one.

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,280
If we been jealous and mistreat other people.

35
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:55,520
You would be rude when picking up the people.

36
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:55,600
Us and ourness. And what is this wheel? What can happen things, feel, struggle and distraction as is. Any and all of those things will happen when we act on the move.

37
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:01,360
people, other people will treat us the same way. Whatever we do will always come back

38
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,600
to us. We also have a lot of discriminations. We have our likes and dislikes and because

39
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:13,840
of our selfishness, we do a lot of selfish deeds that create negative karma. There was

40
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,680
a 60-year-old female Buddhist. One day she went to an old monk. She cried, I've been

41
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:26,180
married to my husband for nearly 40 years and I never knew what happiness was. My husband

42
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:32,940
always scolded and beat me and everybody still thinks he's such a good person. I know I probably

43
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:38,460
owe him from previous life, but how come it's still not paid off? The old monk calmly said,

44
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:45,880
long time ago, there was a wealthy businessman. He had many wives and concubine and a family,

45
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,540
but he fell in love with a pretty maid.

46
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,660
He forcefully

47
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:57,840
took her and agreed to take her as a concubine. So he used her physically when he was happy

48
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:04,940
and beat her when he was upset. So this maid's hope of becoming a concubine never happened

49
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:11,800
and she passed away with deep hatred toward this businessman. So you were the businessman

50
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:17,740
and your current husband was the abuse maid. That's why he's treating you this way. This

51
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,900
woman totally believed in the story.

52
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:27,080
And she sincerely confessed her sin for mistreating the maid. And she never resent her husband

53
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:35,420
again. So we need to realize awareness. Number one, we need to know our karmic effects. Awareness

54
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:42,500
number two, we need to know our karmic causes. It's all because our cause and effect creating

55
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:48,140
the samsara life that we're experiencing. This is also the void meditation.

56
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:54,800
Understanding the emptiness of everything, it just cause and effect and let go of our

57
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,040
selfishness, replace our afflictions with virtues and good deeds.

58
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:05,680
Now let's look at our worldview. How do we see our world right now? Do we know that we

59
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,440
have a lot of obstacle of knowledge blocking us from understanding the phenomenon that's

60
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:17,380
going on in this world? For example, there's a lot of thing that's unavoidable. Right now,

61
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:23,760
we're going through COVID-19. This is an unprecedented disaster. Why are we experiencing this?

62
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:30,600
It's because of our collective karma of all kinds of killing and consuming of animals.

63
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:37,060
That's why we have to go through this unavoidable disaster. A lot of things are unattainable.

64
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:43,740
We want a good job, a good marriage, a good life, or world peace, but it just seems impossible

65
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,180
to obtain them. And a lot of things are unattainable. So we need to know our karmic causes and let

66
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:52,960
it go. Even if we get the good fortune, it doesn't last. How many families you see that

67
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:59,560
has good fortune for many generations? Not many because it's really hard to retain them.

68
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:06,680
We need to realize the phenomenon, use the unreal meditation to look at these situations.

69
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,740
Even though we have things that are unavoidable, if we can change our thoughts and be positive,

70
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:17,160
think, oh, we have the lockdown, we're staying at home. Now is a good time to memorize that

71
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:22,900
mantra. I always wanted to memorize or to practice meditation and chanting the Buddha's

72
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:30,340
name vigorously. That way you're using this time to do something great. We're making lemonade

73
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:36,200
a la lemon. Even though we cannot obtain things that we want, that just motivates to work

74
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,840
harder and never give up. Even though things are not retainable, we lose the good things

75
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,540
that we have that will prevent us from being spoiled and lazy.

76
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:52,200
So I want to tell you what I want to tell you. I want you to be humble and keep cultivating.

77
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,340
So, Boji Sapha, use the unreal meditation. Know everything is unreal, everything is just

78
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:02,580
cause and effect, but use the current situation to practice, to cultivate, to make ourself

79
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:08,980
better and contribute to the world. Now let's talk about relationships and matters. Relationships

80
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:15,400
are impermanent. There's a lot of divorce and affairs. Love is definitely not forever.

81
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,400
But how we deal with it is very important. If you have a relationship with a married

82
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,120
with this relationship is totally up to us. There was a devoted Buddhist practitioner.

83
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,020
A few years after her marriage, her husband fell in love with another woman. He often

84
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:32,340
traveled with this mistress. But this wife never complained or had a fight about this

85
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:37,360
with her husband. She just stayed calm and took care of the children and farm to make

86
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,920
money for the family. This husband and the mistress had a child. They brought the child

87
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:48,060
back and left the child at home and they went off to play again. This wife took care of

88
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:54,200
the child and took the child in and out of work and while farming. Everybody in the village

89
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,840
poked fun at her for raising the child of the mistress. She just wanted to raise the

90
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:05,120
child and the child grew up thinking that this wife is his biological mother. A few

91
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:12,120
years later, the mistress became a human vegetable from a brain operation. This wife went to

92
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:12,900
visit her mother.

93
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:18,720
The mistress said you're not equal in farm work. You're not equal in farm work.

94
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,220
She was disposed of, she was not equal with the ecology, she was not equal in farm work and

95
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,800
was not equal with the dogs and wild animals of the village. But this wife has a sharp

96
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,080
deficit because she too grew up with her husband as husband. It is very true.

97
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,320
In this relationship, we won't have a service here without hindrance. There is

98
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,360
no need for further intervention. The wife and child now grew together with her husband

99
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:48,600
so everything go through these four stages and the meanings are profound why

100
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:54,300
these things change is very complex karma is very complex it's really hard

101
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,920
to understand for example we have a whole school study called the

102
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,860
consciousness only school it talks about how our consciousness work we have the

103
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,860
eighth consciousness we call it the Alaya consciousness it's actually the

104
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:13,620
warehouse that store all our past actions all our past thoughts when the

105
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:19,620
time comes it ripens into effect it ripens into everything that we are

106
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:25,640
experiencing in the world everything is very profound so we need to realize

107
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:31,400
relationships are impermanent events are changing meanings are profound but we

108
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:37,320
can practice the mean meditation going inward to your Buddha nature that

109
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:37,860
doesn't

110
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:43,340
doesn't change with the outside world. Even though outside everything is changing, there's

111
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:49,760
something that is permanent and is immutable that has a perfect wisdom. That is our true

112
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:56,680
Buddha nature. So that's called the Ming Meditation. So now let's understand further our life and

113
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,540
the universe. When we talk about our lives and universe, we talk about it in terms of

114
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:07,740
space and time. In terms of space, there's 10 directions. North, East, South, West. North,

115
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:13,480
East, North, West. South, East, South, West. Up and down. So in these 10 directions, there's

116
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:20,240
all kinds of different reincarnations going on. So in every world, in every planet, there's

117
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:26,520
all kinds of beings and all kinds of people in this world. We are all interrelated because

118
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:31,520
of our karmic relationship, our karmic influences. For example, we are all interrelated because

119
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,920
of our karmic influences. For example, we have international dynamics. What happens

120
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:41,860
in one country will impact the welfare and the economics of many other countries. Climate

121
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:47,260
change in one part of the world will impact another part of the world. Sunspots, their

122
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:54,440
large dark patches that cover the sun will affect the magnetic field of the Earth. So

123
00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:01,460
everything is interrelated and boundless. Why is it boundless? Because everything is

124
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:09,340
vibration from our thoughts, from our mind. You probably heard of the 100th monkey effect.

125
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:14,700
They studied a group of monkeys in Japan. There was one monkey that started washing

126
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:21,800
the sweet potato before eating it. And 99 monkeys started learning the same behavior.

127
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:29,280
So at that critical point of the 100th monkey learning the same behavior, every monkey on

128
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:34,280
the island started doing the same thing. Soon enough, all different islands and all over

129
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:42,220
the world, monkeys started washing their potatoes. Why is that? Because our thought has vibrations.

130
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:48,480
So our loving kindness, our good thought can change the world, can vibrate throughout the

131
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,560
entire universe. So know the power of our mind, our true suchness.

132
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,240
Now let's look at it in terms of time. Past, present, and future.

133
00:11:59,240 --> 00:11:59,260
Okay, let's look at it in terms of time. Past, present, and future.

134
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:04,760
There's reincarnation going on. We have past lives, we have current lives, and we have

135
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:11,200
many, many future lives. We have different environments. For example, ancient time to

136
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,940
modern time, our politics and culture have changed drastically. Before, it was more about

137
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:23,940
morals and virtues. And now it's all about technology and personal consumption.

138
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:29,220
And what's going on in the sixth round? In every world, we have different lifespans.

139
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:34,980
And different conditions. For example, to spend one day in the ghost realm is actually

140
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:41,140
30 days in the human realm. That's why in many Eastern cultures, we observe vegetarian

141
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:48,260
diet on the first and the 15th of the lunar calendar, in respect to the spirits in the

142
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:55,940
ghost realm. Everything is endless because our mind creates everything. So Buddha actually

143
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,060
understands everything about our space and time. And that's why we are living in this

144
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:05,380
world. That's why he has the wisdom of space and wisdom of time. So Buddha is omniscient.

145
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:10,840
He knows everything. But you're like, how can we become like that? We can't. Because

146
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:17,440
our Buddha nature is exactly this way. We say our Buddha nature, it traverses through

147
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:24,040
ten directions. It pursues three periods. You just need to believe in it. Use your mind

148
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,020
to change the world. In the Shurigama Sutra, it says the universe

149
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:35,580
in the enlightened mind is like a single bubble in the sea. So the whole universe inside

150
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:42,260
our wonderful mind is only like a tiny little bubble. It also says the universe in our mind

151
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:49,420
is like a tiny cloud floating in the boundless sky. The whole universe inside our mind is

152
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:55,460
only a tiny little dot. That's how wonderful our Buddha nature is. So believe in yourself

153
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,980
that you have the perfect mind creating the universe.

154
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:05,520
All we need to do is keep cultivating the void meditation, the unreal meditation, and

155
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:12,500
the mean meditation. We will rediscover our own true nature. So that's the class for today.

156
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:19,060
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. Hope everybody use your mind to transform this world into

157
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:23,580
a beautiful, loving, pure land. So thank you for listening. Amitabha.
