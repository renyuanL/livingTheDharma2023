00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,840
Today we will talk about Transforming the Five Corruptions.

2
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,440
In the Amitabha Sutra, Shakyamuni Buddha calls our world the world of five corruptions.

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,160
We will learn how to transform the world of five corruptions into purities,

4
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,680
essentially by having faith, vow, and recitation of Amitabha Buddha's name,

5
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,440
we can transform our current world right now into a pure land,

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,080
and after death, we can be reborn in Amitabha's western pure land.

7
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,240
Now let's talk about the five corruptions and their transformation.

8
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,640
Number one, corruption of age.

9
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,160
This is a time when war, natural disaster, and disease are prevalent.

10
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,280
After experiencing the coronavirus last year,

11
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,920
we all feel the corruption of age.

12
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,200
This is due to our collective karmic burden.

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:10,000
As we know, the physical world is created by the karmic seeds in our allayic consciousness.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,200
So our negative karmic seeds ripen into a corrupted world.

15
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,360
Our positive karmic seeds ripen into a purified world.

16
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,680
Thus, when we chant the name Amitabha,

17
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,880
we are transforming the corruption of age into assembly of purity.

18
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,320
This assembly of purity means all the sentient beings that are already in the pure land.

19
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,520
The moment we recite the Buddha's name, we are assembly members already.

20
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,520
And the key of chanting, according to the Great Strength Bodhisattva in the Shogami Sutra,

21
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,280
it says to gather in all six organs through continuous pure mindfulness.

22
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,960
Gather in our six sense organs instead of seeking out for outside stimulants.

23
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,000
Have it come in.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,560
Focus on this.

25
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,120
Focus on the name and continuous chanting.

26
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,880
It is pure mindfulness.

27
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:07,280
Thus, we are creating positive karmic energy that will be creating a purified world.

28
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,880
And the end will be reborn in Amitabha's pure land.

29
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,840
Number two is the corruption of views.

30
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,840
We have five corruptions of views.

31
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,240
Number one, view of our body.

32
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,120
We think this body is extremely important.

33
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,800
So we eat good food, wear good clothes, live in a good place.

34
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,680
But we don't know

35
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,280
that this body is made out of temporary conditions.

36
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,280
It's made out of earth, water, fire, and wind.

37
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:40,160
Earth is our bones, water, our blood, fire, our temperature, and wind, our breathing.

38
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,560
All these are temporary elements.

39
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,760
They are conditions, so we cannot rely on them.

40
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,240
Number two is one-sided view.

41
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,000
A lot of people think that life is annihilated after death.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,120
Other people think that life goes on forever.

43
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,800
Both of these views are one-sided, and they are erroneous.

44
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,360
Number three is the view of prohibitions, wrong precepts.

45
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,000
Some people, they practice unbeneficial ascetic practices,

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,680
such as sleeping on nails or standing on one leg.

47
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,520
And some people are superstitious.

48
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,960
They think, oh, I must wear red because that's good luck.

49
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,120
All these are wrong precepts.

50
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,880
That's not the cause of enlightenment, but we think it's the cause.

51
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,960
Number four is view of views.

52
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,720
So we are attached to views.

53
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,760
They are not the effect, but we think they are the effect.

54
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,440
For example, we have samadhi or concentration.

55
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,280
We think that's enlightenment.

56
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,800
But concentration and enlightenment are two separate things.

57
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,160
So you cannot say that people have deep concentration.

58
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,920
They are already enlightened.

59
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,240
Number five is deviant view.

60
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,320
Deviant view basically do not believe in causation.

61
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,800
Some people, they don't believe in cause and effect.

62
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,800
That's why they do whatever they feel like doing.

63
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,080
All these five, correction of view, all of us have it to a different degree.

64
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:06,960
If we recite Amitabha Buddha's name, then we can transform the correction of views into infinite light.

65
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,400
Light means wisdom.

66
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,160
So no more correction of views and no more darkness.

67
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,880
That's the meaning of the name Amitabha, which means infinite light.

68
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,720
Number 12 of Amitabha's 48 vows, it says,

69
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,720
provided I become a Buddha, if my light is infinite,

70
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,480
if my light is limited in measurement so that it could not illuminate a hundred thousand

71
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:36,320
naota of kothis of Buddha countries, then may I not attain enlightenment.

72
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,240
So if my light is limited, it cannot illuminate to many, many different Buddha countries,

73
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,640
then I will not become enlightened.

74
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,720
Buddha is already enlightened, so he is infinite light.

75
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,720
The moment that we chant his name, we also become infinite light.

76
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,960
There are two ways to chant Amitabha Buddha's name.

77
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,160
We can chant on the level of phenomena.

78
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:05,040
That means we see Buddha as an outside entity and we rely on him just like a child longing

79
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,960
for its mother and never forgetting her for a moment.

80
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,400
On another level is the level of inner truth.

81
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:19,040
We know that Amitabha and his pure lamp are inherent features in the creation of our pure

82
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,520
mind.

83
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,120
It's not outside of us.

84
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,960
You are the infinite light.

85
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,880
Number three, corruption alone.

86
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,160
Amitabha Buddha's name is one of the five afflictions.

87
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,960
There are five basic afflictions, greed, anger, ignorance, arrogance, and doubt.

88
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,400
Greed are selfishness, anger, when we're complaining, and bitter, ignorance, we think

89
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,680
there's a self that's separated from others, arrogant, we think we're better than others,

90
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,840
doubt, when we don't believe in our self or the Buddha or Dharma.

91
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,240
We have all these five afflictions.

92
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,040
If we can recite Amitabha Buddha's name, we can transform the corruption of affliction

93
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,880
into eternal still light.

94
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,960
There are four different levels to Amitabha Buddha's pure lamp.

95
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,600
One is the land where saint and ordinary beings dwell together.

96
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,960
That's where we will go.

97
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,480
Number two is the land of expedient liberation where our heads live.

98
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,680
Number three is the land of real reward.

99
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,760
That's where the bodhisattvas are.

100
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,040
Lastly is the land of eternal still light.

101
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,560
That's where Buddha is.

102
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,880
Amitabha is extremely compassionate.

103
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:30,240
So he set up his pure lamp that all four worlds, they are all connected to each other.

104
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,920
The moment that we chant Amitabha Buddha's name, we immediately dwell in eternal still

105
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,480
light.

106
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:43,200
This lamp has no form because that's the land of Buddha's dharmakaya, his real essence.

107
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,640
When we chant, the key is our inner stillness.

108
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,920
Focus on the name.

109
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,640
We're not thinking, have no afflictions.

110
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,720
We're not having a chaotic mind.

111
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,960
We're connecting to our inner peace.

112
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,200
To our pure mind.

113
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,320
Number four is corruption of being.

114
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:06,480
Because of our corruption of views and corruption of afflictions, we have this body and mind

115
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,480
that is coarse and debased.

116
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:14,320
But by reciting Amitabha Buddha's name, we transform the corruption of beings into lotus

117
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,120
flowers.

118
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:22,000
There are four kinds of birth in this world, which is womb, egg, moisture, and transformation.

119
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,600
Womb like us human.

120
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,960
We are the mother's womb.

121
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,720
Egg like chicken.

122
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,720
Moisture like mosquitoes.

123
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,280
And transformation, all the heavenly beings are transformation body.

124
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,240
When we go to the western pure land, we'll be metamorphosis of lotus flower.

125
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,960
Lotus flower symbolizes purity.

126
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,120
It's growing out of the mud, but it's not contaminated by the mud.

127
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,520
It's still pure and beautiful.

128
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,760
When we recite Amitabha Buddha's name, we already have a lotus flower growing in the

129
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,040
western pure land.

130
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,080
The cause and the effect is simultaneous.

131
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,760
In the Song Dynasty, there was a lady of Yue.

132
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:07,440
She devoted her whole life chanting Amitabha Buddha's name, and she led all her servants

133
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,560
into chanting.

134
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,240
One of her servants was lacking up, so she scolded her.

135
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,880
The servant became extremely diligent.

136
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,720
After a while, the servant passed away and went to the pure land.

137
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,400
She came back into another servant's dream to thank the lady for teaching her pure land

138
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:24,960
Buddhism.

139
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,520
The lady said, I will only believe it if she comes into my dream.

140
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,680
The next night, she dreamed of the servant.

141
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,600
Then the lady asked her, if you're in the pure land, can you take me there?

142
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,120
And the servant said, sure.

143
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,600
So she brought her to the western pure land.

144
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,880
And most amazingly, she saw the lotus flower.

145
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,760
They all have names of the practitioners that were alive at the time.

146
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,560
So she was amazed to see their flowers there.

147
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,200
Finally, she saw her own lotus flower.

148
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,080
This is a big, beautiful, bright lotus flower.

149
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,640
This is a big, beautiful, bright lotus flower.

150
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,320
This is a big, beautiful, bright lotus flower.

151
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,000
With diamond pedestal.

152
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,600
She was extremely happy.

153
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,520
And then she woke up from her dream.

154
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:07,760
In that same year, on her 80th birthday, she passed away standing up holding an incense

155
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,800
in her hand.

156
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,400
So we all have a lotus flower when we are chanting the Amitabha Buddha's name.

157
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,200
So have faith in this transformation.

158
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,920
Number five is corruption of life.

159
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,440
Our life is very short.

160
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,680
We don't even live up to 100 for most of us.

161
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,480
We don't even live up to 100 for most of us.

162
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:30,400
But if we recite Amitabha Buddha's name, we transform the corruption of life into infinite

163
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:30,880
life.

164
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,440
That's another name for Amitabha Buddha.

165
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,440
His name is infinite life.

166
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,040
And when we chant his name, we also become infinite life.

167
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:46,480
And number 13 of his 48 vows, it says, provided I become a Buddha, if the measure of my life

168
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:54,320
is limited, even by counting 100,000 naiveta kottis of kaupas, then may I not attain in

169
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,280
enlightenment.

170
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:02,560
So if my life is limited, even up to 100,000 naiveta kottis, which is a long, long, long

171
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,920
time, then I will not become enlightened.

172
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,920
So Buddha's life is infinite.

173
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,200
And when we chant his name, we become infinite life.

174
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,280
What's so good about infinite life?

175
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:18,000
Right now, we cannot cultivate into Buddhahood because our life is too short.

176
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,080
By the time we finish eating, sleeping, playing, working, there's not much time to cultivate.

177
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,600
But if we have infinite life, then we'll definitely have time to cultivate into Buddhahood.

178
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:36,080
So in summary, if we don't chant Amitabha Buddha's name, then we will sure be imprisoned

179
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:42,800
by our time, enmeshed in our misguided views, ensnared by afflictions, dressed complacently

180
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:49,280
in our degradation and weakness of body and mind, and will be swallowed up by impermanence

181
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,560
without life flashing by too quickly for us to cope.

182
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,240
So this is called samsara.

183
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,440
Samsara is the process of suffering and the cause of suffering.

184
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:05,840
To cite chanting Amitabha, this is the cessation of suffering and the path to end suffering.

185
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,840
So this is the realization of the Four Noble Truths.

186
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:16,240
In conclusion, why does chanting Amitabha Buddha's name work so well is because wondrous

187
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,880
cause and wondrous effect are not apart from the one mind.

188
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,240
The wondrous cause of reciting Amitabha Buddha's name and the wondrous effect are not apart

189
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:24,960
from the one mind.

190
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:29,360
The wondrous effect of the purity and the pure land is not apart from our one mind.

191
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:35,280
These are inherent features of our mind and they are the creation of our mind.

192
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:40,400
We have to know this and then we will know that chanting will transform our life right

193
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:40,800
now.

194
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,640
It will bring us to the Western Pure Land after we pass away.

195
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:50,240
This is a time of churn oil, but it's also a time for spiritual awakening.

196
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,920
So rely on Amitabha Buddha and chant his name.

197
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,320
That's the class for today, thank you for listening, Amitabha.
