00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Today we will talk about Twelve Dependent Origination.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This is the truth about reincarnation.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We will incorporate the Twelve Dependent Origination with the Four Noble Truths and Three Dharma Seals

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and understand their importance to Pure Land Buddhism.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Let's first look at the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Number one is ignorance.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Ignorance is our delusion about our own existence.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We think there is a real self.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Being selfish is normal and we have a lot of greed, anger and ignorance.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Because of our ignorance, we have formation, which is our volitional activities.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We started creating karma with our body, speech and mind.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This can be wholesome or unwholesome.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Then because of the formation, we have consciousness, our alaya consciousness.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Now find the right parents and when the parents are having copulation,

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
this consciousness attached to the egg and the sperm and now the mother is officially pregnant.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Then we have name and form.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
When the mind is not fully developed, it's called the name.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And when the body is not fully developed, it's called the form.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Then we develop the six senses.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Our eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body and mind.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
We come into contact with the world when the mother gives birth.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And then we will start to have feelings, experiencing sensations such as pleasure, displeasure and neutral feeling.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We will have a lot of craving.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
This includes all the love and hate, likes, dislikes and greed and anger.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
We have a lot of clinging.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
There's a lot of grasping and attachment to all the world.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
There's a lot of attachment to all the worldly things.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Then we will have becoming, creating new karma, new karmic formation.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Then we have birth, emergence of new born being.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Then we have aging and death all over again.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This is two layers of cause and effect through three periods.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Ignorance and formation, these are past causes.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Consciousness, name and form.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Six senses, contact and feeling.

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
These five are our present.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Effects.

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Craving, clinging, becoming, that's our present.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Causes.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Birth and aging, that's our future effect.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's two layers of cause and effect.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So dependent, ordination, it means cause, condition and effect.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
One relies on the other.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
This arising, that arises.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
This ceasing, that ceases.

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
This is a cycle.

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
If we follow the cycle, this would be called samsara.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But if we reverse the cycle, it's called nirvana.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
When ignorance is the condition, formation arises.

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
When formation is the condition, consciousness arises, so on and so forth.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So that's going forward with this reincarnation.

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
But if we learn Buddhism, we try to reverse the cycle.

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So we want to go against the current.

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
If we don't want aging, death, don't have birth.

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
If we don't want to have birth, don't have becoming.

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
If we don't want to have becoming, don't have clinging.

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
If we don't want formation, don't have ignorance.

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
With the cessation of ignorance, formation ceases.

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
With the cessation of formation, consciousness ceases.

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So on and so forth.

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So we want to end this reincarnation.

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The point of Buddhism is to reverse the samsara and reach nirvana,

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
which means ultimate peace and liberation.

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
From afflictions.

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
This 12 dependent origination is the same as the Four Noble Truths.

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Four Noble Truths is suffering, cause of suffering, cessation of suffering,

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
path to end suffering.

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Our suffering is 3 to 7.

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That's our current suffering.

69
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Birth and aging, 11 and 12.

70
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
That's our future suffering.

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What is the cause of our suffering?

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It is our ignorance and formation.

73
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
That's our past causes.

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Then our present causes is our craving, clinging, and becoming.

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Therefore, you can see that the key is to get out of samsara,

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
to work on the craving, clinging, and becoming.

77
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
We need to stop this rope that is tying us down.

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
In every situation, we have the right to choose.

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Either we follow the samsara and go with our craving,

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
or we follow the Dharma and reach nirvana.

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
There was a businessman who loved gold.

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So he worked day and night to accumulate a lot of money and a lot of gold.

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
He was afraid that people were going to steal his gold.

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So he hid the gold in a big bottle and buried the bottle under the ground.

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
In his lifetime, he accumulated 7 bottles of gold.

86
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But because he worked too hard, he died young.

87
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
After death, because of his craving for gold,

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
he reincarnated into a poisonous snake.

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The snake that guarded the 7 bottles of gold.

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And this happened lifetime after lifetime for thousands of years.

91
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Until one day, he felt extremely tired of this life.

92
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So he left the 7 bottles and went on the road and found a passerby.

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
He asked,

94
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Can you please help me to bring a bottle of gold to the temple and donate to the temple?

95
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The compassionate monk at the temple accepted the offering

96
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
and expanded the Dharma to the temple.

97
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The snake was refreshed with Dharma joy

98
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
and decided to donate the other 6 bottles of gold.

99
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
With this act of giving and renunciation of craving,

100
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
he then reincarnated as a heavenly being

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
and later became a human.

102
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
He was Sharaputra, Shakyamuni Buddha's disciple

103
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
who attained Arhatship.

104
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So his craving was his love for gold.

105
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What is our craving?

106
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Understand what we're going through.

107
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
What are we craving for?

108
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
We need to cut off the rope of Samsara

109
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
because it's a whole big massive suffering

110
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
and it's actually a big lie.

111
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
We don't want to keep going through the cycle of reincarnation.

112
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
In order to end the Samsara and reach Nirvana,

113
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
we need to understand the 3 Dharma seals.

114
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Seals are like stamps that prove the authenticity

115
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
that this is Buddha's teaching.

116
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
There are 3 stamps.

117
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Number 1 is impermanence.

118
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
As you can see in this 12 links of dependent origination,

119
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
everything is condition arising.

120
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Therefore, they're constantly changing.

121
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Nothing is stable or fixed.

122
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So impermanence is the truth.

123
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Impermanence is not a bad thing.

124
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It is only suffering because we believe

125
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
that things should be permanent.

126
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
We think this body should be permanent.

127
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
We think relationship or our money or our wealth

128
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
should be permanent.

129
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So when it changes, it becomes suffering.

130
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So accept the impermanence

131
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
and use all the impermanence situation to cultivate.

132
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So when the problem arises,

133
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
calmly discern what is the cause and condition

134
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
that is causing today's problem.

135
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What can I do to change the conditions

136
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
and make things better and benefit everyone?

137
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And I would be wrong if any cause of suffering arises in me,

138
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
such as grief, anger, and ignorance.

139
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And I need to work diligently on my causes

140
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
through my thoughts, speech, and action.

141
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
With every impermanence situation,

142
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I should enhance my wisdom and compassion.

143
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So use this impermanence wisely.

144
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Then we have non-self.

145
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
In this 12 links of dependent origination,

146
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
you don't see an I.

147
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
There's not an I.

148
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Everything is just cause and effect.

149
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
This is condition arising.

150
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So in the condition arising,

151
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
there's not a me.

152
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But we think there is an independent me

153
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
that is independent from all the dependent origination,

154
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
which is not true.

155
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The me that we think is independent, existing,

156
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
that is a pseudo-self.

157
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
For example, someone yelled at me

158
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
and I'm upset.

159
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
That's because I think there is a real Tracy.

160
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
That's being yelled at.

161
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
But if we know it's non-self,

162
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
then we'll be liberated from anger.

163
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So break the bond of self-love.

164
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It is the root source of all our delusions.

165
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
See things as they are.

166
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
As condition arising,

167
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
there is not a me in this condition arising.

168
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
When you really see the truth,

169
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
you will see true equality.

170
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
No one person is better than other.

171
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And I'm no better than anyone else.

172
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Everybody is equal in this condition arising.

173
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
When you see this,

174
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
you will have true equality

175
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
and true compassion toward all beings.

176
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And then you realize everybody is together as one.

177
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Because everybody is empty in essence

178
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
and everyone is non-self.

179
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
When we understand impermanence and non-self,

180
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
we will reach Nirvana.

181
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Nirvana is not death

182
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
or a place.

183
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Nirvana is the cessation of afflictions,

184
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
delusions.

185
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
We're liberated from Samsara.

186
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
This is our normal state.

187
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
We are originally Nirvana.

188
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's not something we're trying to get.

189
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
We just need to see clearly

190
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
the truth about Samsara.

191
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Let go of our craving and clinging.

192
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Pure Land Buddhism is the same thing.

193
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Why do we need to go to the Pure Land?

194
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Pure Land is our Nirvana.

195
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
We want to go to Pure Land

196
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
because of our strong vow.

197
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
We want to be detached from this mundane world

198
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
that we keep being trapped in this cycle

199
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
of reincarnation,

200
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
which is a massive lie

201
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
and massive suffering.

202
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
We want to get out of it.

203
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
This is all a self-created jail.

204
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's like we're planting a poisonous tree.

205
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
We keep giving it water,

206
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
keep giving it fertilizer,

207
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
but this is a poisonous tree.

208
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But we keep letting it grow bigger and bigger.

209
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So chanting the name Amitabha

210
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
is to wake us up from this delusion,

211
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
from this upside-down false thinking.

212
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Therefore, Buddhism is not just about

213
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
chanting the name Amitabha.

214
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's about our profound insight

215
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
and understanding about

216
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
impermanence, non-self, and Nirvana.

217
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And then our chanting

218
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
will have real substance

219
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
has real meaning.

220
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Subsequently,

221
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
every recitation of Amitabha

222
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
is now worth more than

223
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
10,000 recitations of Amitabha

224
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
because we have true insight.

225
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Just like if I sincerely say,

226
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm sorry.

227
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's better than I say,

228
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

229
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
but I don't mean it.

230
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And I say it 10,000 times.

231
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's useless, right?

232
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
The real chanting

233
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
is to have real understanding

234
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
of the Dharma

235
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
and want to transform

236
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
and be out of the suffering.

237
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Don't just rely on Amitabha

238
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
to bless us.

239
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
We need to go inside

240
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
and work on ourselves

241
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
to look deeply into our craving,

242
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
cleaning, and becoming,

243
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
and cut off this rope

244
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
that we created for ourselves

245
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
that's entangling us.

246
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Once you're a true Pure Land practitioner,

247
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
then you'll be confident,

248
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
you will be going to the place

249
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
of ultimate bliss,

250
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
which is our Nirvana.

251
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Finally, when you let go

252
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
of all attachments,

253
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
even to the Dharma,

254
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
even to Twelve Dependent Origination,

255
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Four Noble Truths,

256
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
and Three Dharma Seals,

257
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
you will see that

258
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Samsara is the same as Nirvana

259
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
because Samsara is emptiness

260
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
and Nirvana is emptiness.

261
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
That is the ultimate truth,

262
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
and ultimate enlightenment.

263
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
So that's the class for today.

264
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Thank you for listening.

265
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Amitabha.
