1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,720
Today's topic is the Amitabha Sutra.

2
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,220
We might recite the sutra every day, but what does it really mean to us?

3
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:28,920
In this class, we will use OE Master's commentary of Amitabha Sutra to learn about the meaning of this sutra.

4
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:36,140
This sutra talks about the three pillars of Pure Land Buddhism of faith, vow, and practice.

5
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:46,000
In the beginning, it gives a full-scale description of the wonders of the Pure Land to arouse our faith to really believe in the existence of this land.

6
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,740
And it tells us to make real vows of wanting to take rebirth there.

7
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:58,440
And it teaches us how to practice and recite Amitabha Buddha's name in order to reach our goal of rebirth.

8
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,440
Now let's look at faith.

9
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:11,180
First, we learn about all the wonders of the Pure Land, such as the jewel pond, the water of eight merits, the ground that's made out of pure gold, and the birds that are singing the Dharma.

10
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,180
How did all these come about?

11
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:21,940
So it says four times in the sutra that this land of ultimate bliss is complete with all these adornments and virtues.

12
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,660
The OE Master's commentary, it says,

13
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,520
With his great vows, Amitabha creates the cause of the world.

14
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,080
With his great vows, Amitabha creates the cause of the world.

15
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:27,580
With his great vows, Amitabha creates the cause of the world.

16
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:33,360
He creates the causal basis for sentient beings to multiply their good roots.

17
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:41,620
With his great deeds, he creates the conditions for sentient beings to increase their merits and virtues.

18
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,760
There are a couple of factors here.

19
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:53,580
It says in the sutra that we cannot have minor good roots, merits, and virtues, and cause and conditions to go to the Pure Land.

20
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,220
So we need to have ample of these in order to take rebirth.

21
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:56,720
So we need to have ample of these in order to take rebirth.

22
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,220
So we need to have ample of these in order to take rebirth.

23
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:57,720
So we need to have ample of these in order to take rebirth.

24
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,720
Because these are the ingredients that make up the Pure Land.

25
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,220
Because these are the ingredients that make up the Pure Land.

26
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,600
Because these are the ingredients that make up the Pure Land.

27
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,980
It's actually a joint effort between Amidabha and us.

28
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:03,420
It's actually a joint effort between Amidabha and us.

29
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:03,720
So Amidabha is helping us with his 48 great vows and his great deeds of six paramitas.

30
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,220
So Amidabha is helping us with his 48 great vows and his great deeds of six paramitas.

31
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:04,720
So Amidabha is helping us with his 48 great vows and his great deeds of six paramitas.

32
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,220
He creates the cause and the conditions when we recite His name and multiply our guru's, which is our Bodhi mind, Frankfurtest.

33
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:14,320
effort between Amitabha and us. So Amitabha is helping us with his 48 great vows and his

34
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:22,380
great deeds of six pyramidas. He creates the cause and the condition when we recite his

35
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:29,780
name and multiplies our gurus, which is our bodhi mind and increase all our merits and

36
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:36,280
virtues. That's how the Pure Land is constructed. There are three inconceivable powers here.

37
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:43,540
First is the power of Amitabha, his great vows and great deeds. Number two is the power

38
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:50,020
of the Amitabha Buddha's name. And when we recite it, that's how the power is transmitted

39
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:58,240
to us. And the third power is us. When we recite, it creates gurus and merits and virtue

40
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,640
in our own mind.

41
00:02:59,640 --> 00:02:59,740
That's how the Pure Land is constructed. There are three inconceivable powers here.

42
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:07,580
That is how the Pure Land is produced. So we need to have faith in the three inconceivable

43
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:15,020
powers. There is a Russian boy. He's 15 years old, has no hands, but he really wanted to

44
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:20,760
play the piano. He doesn't know how to read music. He just listened to the sound and tried

45
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:27,900
to imitate. And he really did it because he believed that he can play the piano. So if

46
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,600
you have faith, you can accomplish everything.

47
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:36,820
If you believe in the three incredible powers, then chanting Amitabha Buddha's name is really

48
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,600
creating the Pure Land for us.

49
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:45,720
Number two, vow. There are three major benefits that motivate us to make vow to go to the

50
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:51,640
Pure Land. Number one is everyone that is reborn there, we immediately reach the level

51
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:59,460
of avivartika, which means three non-retrogression. Number one, we will never retrogress in our

52
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:05,660
practice of adhat, who is a saint that is out of reincarnation forever. Number two,

53
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:10,920
we will never retrogress in our bodhisattva practice. No matter what happens, we will

54
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:16,280
always have our compassion of wanting to save all sentient beings. Number three, we will

55
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:21,880
never retrogress in our mindfulness. We will always have the wisdom of the Buddha as our

56
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:28,240
mind. Once we get there, we immediately achieve these three non-retrogression. So that's the

57
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,240
first major benefit.

58
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:36,660
Number two, we will be someone who only has one more lifetime to go before Buddhahood.

59
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:42,840
We will be like Maitreya Bodhisattva, the successor of Shakyamuni Buddha. There's only

60
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:50,040
one Buddha in every world. When we get to the Pure Land, we are guaranteed to be a Buddha

61
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,040
elect.

62
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:57,020
Number three, we will be together with all these beings of superior goodness. All the

63
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,220
ordinary people are with the holy Buddha.

64
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:05,500
The saints with their desires extinguished, we will be with them. Over here, it's really

65
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:12,400
hard to find a temple or a teacher who really knows exactly what you need. But over there,

66
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,760
they are all bodhisattva who knows exactly what you need to practice. We will work to

67
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:23,720
end our ignorance and our delusion and reach wondrous enlightenment together. With these

68
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:29,020
three major benefits, we want to make real vow to be reborn there.

69
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:36,560
In summary, making vows with deep faith is precisely the mind of supreme enlightenment.

70
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:43,200
Our Pure Land vow and our Pure Land faith is precisely our Bodhi mind that will bring

71
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:50,580
us into Buddhahood. So going to the Pure Land means reaching Buddhahood. Shen Zhang, master

72
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:57,300
of the Tang Dynasty, he really wanted to learn more Buddhism that was not in China at the

73
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,300
time.

74
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:06,320
He took a pilgrimage from China all the way to India. He experienced insurmountable obstacles.

75
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:11,840
Many times there was not a bird in the sky and not an animal on the ground. It was him

76
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:18,220
and the desert. He kept reciting the Heart Sutra. He went through all the obstacles,

77
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:25,020
reached India and brought back the Yogacara Buddhism, which is the conscious-only school

78
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,240
of Buddhism.

79
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,240
He was the first Chinese master of Buddhism. He was the first Chinese master of Buddhism.

80
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,240
He was the first Chinese master of Buddhism. He was the first Chinese master of Buddhism.

81
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,340
He was the first Chinese master of the school of Yogacara. If he can do that, we can chant

82
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:41,260
Amitabha and go to the Pure Land. It's the same Bodhi resolve, the same Bodhi mind that

83
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,920
will make us become a Buddha.

84
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:51,240
Number three, practice. We need to recite Amitabha, Buddha's name, wholeheartedly.

85
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:58,100
There are two ways to recite the Amitabha's name. Number one is on the phenomenal level.

86
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:07,520
Just like a child relies on his mother, he has no doubt that this person with the smell

87
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:14,160
will take care of him wholeheartedly and he's in no danger. So we rely on Amitabha. That

88
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,940
is on the phenomenal level.

89
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:24,660
Number two is the level of inner truth. To know that Amitabha is in our mind. When we

90
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,220
produce the Buddha's image, our mind is in the Buddha's image. When we produce the Buddha's

91
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,220
image, our mind is in the Buddha's image.

92
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,060
When we produce the Buddha's image, our mind is in the Buddha's image. When we produce the

93
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,100
Buddha's image, our mind is in the Buddha's image. When we produce the Buddha's image,

94
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,160
our mind is in the Buddha's image. When we produce the Buddha's image, our mind is in

95
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,220
the Buddha's image. When we produce the Buddha's image, our mind is in Amitabha.

96
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,140
Our mind is in the Buddha's image, Amitabha is in the Buddha's image, Amitabha is my

97
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,140
mind.

98
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,300
Amitabha also settled down. When we practice Amitabha, Buddha's name is finally also

99
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:57,000
in the Buddha's image. When we practice the Dok

100
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Ik.

101
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:06,660
merit vicariously become yours. Every time you make the sound Amitabha, Amitabha is right

102
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:14,080
in front of you. His light is glowing and you are glowing in his golden light. He merges

103
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:22,540
with you. You are together as one. Your Buddha nature emerges. That's the amazing experience

104
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:32,120
of every one of your recitations. So one recitation is one inconceivableness. The key is to chant

105
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:40,580
Amitabha single-mindedly without confusion. Chant single-mindedly, wholeheartedly, without

106
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:48,060
confusion. We are being confused by our daily experiences. For example, if we have a bad

107
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,780
day at work, we might just forget about chanting.

108
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,280
All the unpleasant things that we do, we forget about chanting. All the unpleasant

109
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:52,520
things that we do, we forget about chanting. All the unpleasant things that we do, we forget

110
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,760
about chanting. All the unpleasant experiences in life, they lose us, clouds us, and confuse

111
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:03,760
us. And we forget about our goal and our mission of becoming a Buddha. Don't let anything get

112
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:12,340
you off track. Go to the Pure Land. Monitor your faith and vow constantly. So single-mindedness

113
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:19,840
means determination of wanting to become a Buddha. So lastly I would like to share a

114
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,260
story. In 1933, I was in the United States.

115
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,900
There was a Mr. Cheng, he was a Pure Land practitioner.

116
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:32,700
He wanted to devote all his time in his practice, so he gave the family business to the younger

117
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,700
brother.

118
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,600
He just focused on chanting.

119
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,960
He learned how to expound the Amitabha Sutra.

120
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:45,460
Six years later, one day after he finished expounding the Amitabha Sutra, there was only

121
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,060
five, six people left.

122
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:51,500
He said to his friend, please rent me a room, I'm leaving now.

123
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,500
Seriously?

124
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,060
His friend asked, if you're leaving, why do you need to rent a room?

125
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,180
He said, I'm going to Amitabha's Pure Land.

126
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:03,560
I don't want to die in someone's place, so please rent me a place.

127
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:08,620
His friend said, why don't you just come to my house and we will gather all the practitioners.

128
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:12,100
They can watch you and see how you go to the Pure Land.

129
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,000
They all went to this friend's house.

130
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,560
He just sat there in the full lotus position.

131
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,980
People asked him, do you want to say something before you leave?

132
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:21,480
He said, no.

133
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,580
Just watch me come and go freely.

134
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,860
Just witness it and believe in it.

135
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:31,240
And he sat there with a smile on his face for less than 15 minutes.

136
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,080
He passed and went to the Pure Land.

137
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:39,500
His younger brother, who didn't believe in him, after he witnessed it, he wanted to learn

138
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,500
from him.

139
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,060
After three years, that also happened to his younger brother.

140
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:49,040
He also knew ahead of time his date and time of his rebirth.

141
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,480
Everyone can do it.

142
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,480
Have these three years.

143
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,500
Three pillars of faith, vow, and practice.

144
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:00,160
When you recite the Amitabha Sutra, know what it means.

145
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,080
It's really the Pure Land and this is your lifetime goal.

146
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,200
Today is New Year's Eve.

147
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:13,200
Hope everybody make the New Year resolution using this lifetime to chant Amitabha, to

148
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,460
go to the Western Pure Land and reach Buddhahood.

149
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,920
So that's the class for today.

150
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,920
Thank you for listening.

151
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,920
Happy New Year's.

152
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,420
Amitabha.

153
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,480
Satsang with Mooji
