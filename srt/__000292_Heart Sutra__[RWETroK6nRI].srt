1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,680
Today we are going to talk about the Heart Sutra.

2
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,640
It's called the Heart Sutra for three reasons.

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,000
One is the heart of a much larger Maha-Prajna-Paramita Sutra.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,040
Two is the heart of all Buddha's teachings.

5
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,960
Three is talking about our pure heart, the Buddha nature.

6
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,600
In the beginning of the Sutra, it says,

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:42,080
when Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva was practicing the profound Prajnaparamita,

8
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:47,200
he illuminated the five skandhas and saw that they are all empty,

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,720
and he crossed beyond all suffering and difficulty.

10
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,920
Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva is who we call Guanyin Bodhisattva.

11
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,960
He was practicing profound Prajnaparamita.

12
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,040
What is Prajnaparamita?

13
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,400
Prajnaparamita is supreme, unique wisdom.

14
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,720
And Paramita is from the shore of suffering to the other shore of Nirvana.

15
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,760
So we need to practice this Prajnaparamita.

16
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,320
There are actually three kinds of Prajnaparamita.

17
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,720
One is the Prajnaparamita of language.

18
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,520
The words that we see here in the Sutra, that is Prajnaparamita of language.

19
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,680
Two is the Prajnaparamita of contemplative illumination.

20
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,000
We need to contemplate on the words.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,840
Then we will reach number three, the Prajnaparamita of characteristics of actuality.

22
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,880
Our true nature, we call the real mark or actuality.

23
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:47,440
So we need to have the words, then the contemplation to reach the actuality.

24
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:53,440
Just like we have a car and we have a driver, then we will reach the destination.

25
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,600
This Prajnaparamita is called profound because it's not superficial.

26
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,720
It's not superficial wisdom or intellect.

27
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:08,240
It's actually totally aligned with our true treasury of Tathagata, our true Buddha nature.

28
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,320
That's why it's called profound.

29
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,480
What do we see with this Prajnaparamita?

30
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:20,240
We actually see the emptiness of our five skandhas, the body and mind we're using right now.

31
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,000
It's not the true self.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,840
So that's what we see when we really have the wisdom.

33
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,040
It goes on to say that,

34
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:33,760
the five skandhas are empty, no form, feeling, cognition, formation or consciousness.

35
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,920
This body is called the form.

36
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,880
We have feelings of pleasure and displeasure.

37
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:45,280
We have our perception and we have our deeper mental formation, deeper attachment.

38
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,640
Then we have our storehouse, the alaya consciousness.

39
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,960
None of this is me.

40
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,920
All these are just conditioned existence.

41
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,840
It goes on further to say,

42
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,360
the six sense organs, no eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body or mind.

43
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:08,800
And there's not the six sense objects, no sight, sound, smell, taste, touch or dharma.

44
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:15,040
Together, the six sense organs and the six sense objects are called the 12 bases.

45
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:22,240
And then no fields of the eyes up to and including no field of mind consciousness.

46
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,440
We have the eye consciousness, ear consciousness,

47
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,000
all the way up to the mind consciousness.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,360
This is called the 18 realms of beings.

49
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,320
This is how we experience the world.

50
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,160
We think this is me.

51
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,840
This is my life.

52
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,440
But we need to understand that this is not my life.

53
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,360
This is not the real me.

54
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,560
If you are more attached to the mental experience,

55
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,440
we will tell you about the five skandhas.

56
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,400
Because four out of five is mental.

57
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,040
If you are more attached to physical,

58
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,920
then we will tell you about the 12 bases.

59
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,320
Because 11 out of the 12 are physical.

60
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,480
Only the mind is mental.

61
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,480
If you're equally attached to the mental and the physical,

62
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,640
we will tell you about the 18 realms altogether.

63
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,360
Depending on what you're more attached to,

64
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,600
then Buddha tells you different things.

65
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,960
Only to let you see that they are empty and it's not the real you.

66
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,640
When someone has prajna,

67
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,360
it doesn't mean they do not hear and do not see and shut off everything.

68
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,600
It means they still see and hear,

69
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,360
but they use their heart.

70
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,320
For example,

71
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,520
if someone utter some words that's insulting to us,

72
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,960
humiliating us,

73
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,200
a saint will hear it differently.

74
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,200
In the Sravagama Sutra,

75
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,280
it tells us how Guan Yin Bodhisattva became enlightened.

76
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,080
He said,

77
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,120
I entered the flow through hearing,

78
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,600
forgot objective states.

79
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,960
So he entered the flow,

80
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,960
of his Buddha nature,

81
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,040
the treasury of the Thakta,

82
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,880
through the sense of hearing.

83
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,520
He forgot all objective states.

84
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,840
The hearing with the ears,

85
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,200
what is being heard,

86
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,720
both disappear.

87
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,000
They're empty.

88
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,120
Moreover,

89
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,360
emptiness and what's being empty also cease to be.

90
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,240
That's when you really see the emptiness of the five skandhas.

91
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,280
You will not hear things the same way anymore.

92
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,880
It says in the Heart Sutra,

93
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,920
Bodhisattva through reliance on the Prajnaparamita

94
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,560
is unimpeded in his mind.

95
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,800
Because there's no impediment,

96
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,320
he is not afraid,

97
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,560
and he leaves distorted dream thinking far behind.

98
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,440
So a Bodhisattva rely on this Prajnaparamita of emptiness.

99
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,920
He has no more impediment in his mind.

100
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,280
He's not worried about this person's insulting me

101
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,880
or humiliating me.

102
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,880
He has no more worry or stress,

103
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,320
about these words.

104
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,960
He's not afraid of what other people say

105
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,040
or whatever happened to him.

106
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,800
That's why he has no more deluded false thinking,

107
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,040
the distorted dreamlike thoughts.

108
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,880
He leaves it all behind.

109
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,360
When you use the Prajnaparamita,

110
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,360
that's when we really live a carefree and happy life.

111
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,040
So a true Bodhisattva is very flexible,

112
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,080
tolerant,

113
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,000
full of love and compassion and gratefulness

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,560
for all.

115
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,080
He's very open minded,

116
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,600
and he gives you all the answers

117
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,040
to all sentient beings.

118
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,240
They live life through a whole different experience.

119
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:38,000
The top part here is the attachment of the mundane people to the five skandhas.

120
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,800
The bottom part is the attachment of the saints to the Dharma.

121
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,120
So the Buddha further breaks down our attachment to the Dharma.

122
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,920
First, the 12 dependent origination.

123
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,840
No ignorance or ending of ignorance up to and include

124
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,080
or ending of old age and death.

125
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,000
The 12 dependent origination starts with ignorance

126
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,600
and it ends with the 12th link of old age and death.

127
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,400
So there's not the samsara going down

128
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,880
or the ending of ignorance or ending of old age and death,

129
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,880
the nirvana going up.

130
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,880
So none of this is real.

131
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,920
Just like everything is happening in the dream,

132
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,880
whatever that samsara that's going out in the dream to awaken person

133
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,680
is not important.

134
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:30,080
So we need to see the emptiness to break free from our attachment to the dream.

135
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,640
In the Heart Sutra, it says form does not differ from emptiness.

136
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,120
Emptiness does not differ from form.

137
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,200
Form itself is emptiness.

138
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,960
Empty itself is form.

139
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,680
You can replace the form with anything.

140
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,000
In here, you can replace it with samsara or nirvana.

141
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,920
For example, samsara does not differ from emptiness.

142
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,520
Emptiness does not differ from form.

143
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,760
That's not different from samsara.

144
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,160
Samsara itself is emptiness.

145
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,320
Empty itself is samsara.

146
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:04,800
There's no production of samsara and there is nothing destroyed.

147
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,200
You don't destroy the samsara to get nirvana.

148
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,360
Samsara is not defiled and nirvana is not pure.

149
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,800
Samsara is not diminishing and nirvana is not increasing.

150
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,760
So we need to break all the duality.

151
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,280
That's prajna.

152
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,360
And in here, there's endless suffering and there is no justification and full of emptiness.

153
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,040
Everything is gone.

154
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,400
There are no end to suffering and where to suffer.

155
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,400
All is less than the same.

156
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,920
You have to rid of all your sufferings and just leave all the changes in your life.

157
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,760
And let go of all your sufferings and are never alone in method of Jennanya.

158
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,480
And that's the kinda of emphatic Sufi in there.

159
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,080
With the samsara, it's clear that you are a multitude with each other and justENA

160
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,360
انكل westernا

161
00:08:53,680 --> 00:09:01,440
emptiness, empty itself is suffering and suffering is not produced and cessation of suffering

162
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:09,080
is not destroying the suffering. Suffering itself is not defiled and cessation of suffering

163
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:16,420
is not pure and suffering is not diminishing and ending of suffering is not increasing.

164
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:23,780
We need to break from all duality of good or bad or increasing, diminishing. That's

165
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:29,760
when you're really free. So let go of our attachment to the dharma. Then Buddha says

166
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:37,440
there's no six pyramidas, no understanding. This is the last pyramid. Bodhisattva, they're

167
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:46,120
attached to their six pyramidas of giving, holding precepts, endurance, diligence, concentration

168
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,220
and wisdom.

169
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:53,640
wisdom. This understanding is the wisdom. So do not be attached to prajna either. There

170
00:09:53,640 --> 00:10:02,260
is no prajna to gain or to have or to cultivate. It is what it is. So let go of our attachment

171
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:10,060
to the understanding, the last pyramid. Lastly, there is no bodhi to gain. There is no Buddhahood

172
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:18,560
to attain. There is no attaining. So the conclusion is because nothing is attained. So there is

173
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:27,120
nothing to gain, nothing to have, nothing to attain. When you reach this level of wisdom,

174
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:34,620
you will truly be carefree and you will have no more impediment of any kind and no stress,

175
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:40,060
no worry, no problem. Long ago, Guanyin Bodhisattva already made

176
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:45,780
great vows to save all sentient beings from suffering. But he saw so many of the people

177
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:52,680
that he saved went back to their old ways of greed, anger, and ignorance and kept reincarnating.

178
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:58,780
He felt great despair in his heart, finally gave up and relinquished his bodhi resolve.

179
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:05,800
At this moment, his body shattered into a thousand pieces. That's when his teacher Amitabha

180
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,060
Buddha came to the rescue and told him,

181
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,060
Remember the emptiness.

182
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:15,780
The emptiness of the self and all sentient beings are just conditioned existence not

183
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:22,860
to be attached to. That's when he had a moment of epiphany. And his body reconstructed and

184
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:28,820
transformed into one thousand hands and one thousand eyes. That's why you see the one

185
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:32,500
thousand hands and eyes Guanyin Bodhisattva.

186
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:39,560
So have prajna. Do not be attached to anything or anyone. That's when you can really save

187
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,060
everybody.

188
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:48,300
In conclusion, all Buddhas of the Three Periods of Time attain Anuttara Samyaya Sambodhi through

189
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:55,940
reliance on Prajna Pyramida. All Buddhas of the past, present, and future attain Buddhahood

190
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:03,020
through prajna. Anuttara Samyaya Sambodhi means unsurpassable, complete, and perfect

191
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:06,380
enlightenment only through prajna.

192
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,060
So reside in your own innate prajna.

heart. That's the class for today. Thank you for listening. Amitabha.
