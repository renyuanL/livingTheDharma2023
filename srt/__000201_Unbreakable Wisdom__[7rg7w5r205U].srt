1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,600
Today we are going to talk about the Unbreakable Wisdom.

2
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,400
This is from the Diamond Sutra.

3
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,480
Diamond is a metaphor for unbreakable wisdom.

4
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,760
So we are going to talk about this perfect wisdom.

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,360
We are going to go straight into the last chapter of the Sutra.

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,520
It says all things are conditioned existence.

7
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,040
Everything has many different components, many different factors and parts.

8
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,160
For example, in Buddhism we talk about karma.

9
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:55,440
So from my prior life, good deeds and bad deeds caused me to have this body that I'm having here today.

10
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,960
And based on all the different factors, it's going to change.

11
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,600
I'm going to go through old age.

12
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,520
I'm going to go through sickness.

13
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,600
I'm going to go through death.

14
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,680
Everything is changing.

15
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,080
Anything that's conditioned existence, it will change.

16
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,440
It's not permanent.

17
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,600
All the components are going to change.

18
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,320
So definitely everything will change.

19
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,560
Second of all, it's unreal.

20
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,680
When we say unreal, we mean three things.

21
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,080
First, it's not permanent.

22
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,400
It's not forever the same.

23
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,120
Second, it does not exist by itself.

24
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,200
No, I cannot exist by myself.

25
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,600
There are many different parts, different components for me to exist here today.

26
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,880
So it's not real.

27
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,120
Lastly, it cannot be controlled.

28
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:46,240
I cannot control how my body is going to age or when it's going to die.

29
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,680
So it's not real.

30
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,800
With everything that is conditioned existence, we can know for sure that it will definitely change.

31
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,640
And it's unreal.

32
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,320
Now it talks about six things.

33
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,520
Six metaphors to describe this conditioned existence.

34
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:11,760
It's like a dream, a mirage, a bubble, or a shadow, or a door drop, and a flash of lightning.

35
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,560
There was a story about a poor student named Mr. Lu.

36
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,560
He was going into the city to take the Imperial exam.

37
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,440
He was tired, so he checked into a hotel.

38
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,800
The hotel owner said, oh, you must be tired.

39
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,080
Let me go cook you dinner.

40
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,240
Let me go cook you dinner.

41
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,360
Let me go cook you dinner.

42
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,880
So Mr. Lu went into his room and took a nap.

43
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,160
He had a dream.

44
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,240
He dreamt that he took first place in the Imperial exam.

45
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,840
He married the daughter of the most wealthy person in the city.

46
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,600
And he became a very prominent government official.

47
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,920
One day, his nemesis falsely accused him of a crime.

48
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,000
So the emperor sent him out of exile for years.

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Later, the emperor realized he

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,200
was falsely accused, brought him back, gave back his position, and later promoted him again.

51
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,120
So he enjoyed everything.

52
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,320
And he had many children and many grandkids.

53
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,920
And he was getting old.

54
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,200
Then he heard a sound knocking on the door.

55
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,680
Mr. Lu, your porridge is cooked.

56
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,040
So he woke up.

57
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,240
The time it took to cook the porridge, his whole life went by.

58
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,680
That is to show you our life is like a dream.

59
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,280
It's like a mirage.

60
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,560
Mirage is an optical illusion.

61
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,080
We think it's real.

62
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:41,920
For example, the success, fame, or position that you hold, it's all gonna change.

63
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,960
Can change for the better or change for the worse.

64
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,640
One day you might lose it.

65
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,560
One day you can get it back.

66
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,480
But it's forever changing.

67
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,440
Your success, it's like a mirage.

68
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,320
It's like a bubble.

69
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,520
We all dream of the perfect love.

70
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,280
The perfect marriage.

71
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,400
But do you know your partner is a conditioned existence?

72
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,000
Everything that he or she likes every day will change.

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,880
So how can you expect the relationship to be the same forever?

74
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,560
That is not possible.

75
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,120
Marriage, love, it's also like a bubble.

76
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,480
It's like a shadow.

77
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,840
Like a black image.

78
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,000
You cannot touch the image.

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,280
It's not real.

80
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,240
For example,

81
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,360
we all want to have

82
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,880
the perfect image of being a great person,

83
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,600
a mom,

84
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,960
a great doctor,

85
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,240
whatever we are.

86
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,720
But that is still just an image like a shadow.

87
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,400
Or like a dewdrop.

88
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,000
Just a little drop of water.

89
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,680
When the sun comes out, it evaporates.

90
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,280
That's just like our life.

91
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,440
It's a very short life that we are here on this earth today.

92
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,600
We should treasure every moment and be the best that we can be.

93
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,160
It's like a flash of lightning.

94
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,000
We all want to keep our youth.

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,240
We want to look 18 all the time.

96
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,240
Some people have plastic surgeries,

97
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,960
go on diets just to keep their youth.

98
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,720
But it's not possible.

99
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,440
Your youth is like a flash of lightning.

100
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,160
These are six metaphors that describe all things in life.

101
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,960
So one should contemplate upon all things in this wisdom.

102
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,960
Not to force yourself to look at things this way or be pessimistic.

103
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,600
Or hate your life.

104
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,320
No.

105
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,360
To see things in a clear way is to understand the truth.

106
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,600
See the reality of things.

107
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,000
That way you will be so much more.

108
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,920
You can reach your potential.

109
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,880
And bring out your true Buddha nature.

110
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,080
Your true self.

111
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,120
Now we go to the body of the sutra.

112
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,920
Talking about four forms.

113
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,960
Four concepts that we are attached to.

114
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,880
Preventing us from seeing.

115
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,920
The truth.

116
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,640
And having the unbreakable wisdom.

117
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,960
First is the form of the self.

118
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,800
We all have a strong idea about me.

119
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,800
Me as a person.

120
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,320
About what's mine.

121
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,520
My family.

122
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,840
Or I'm a successful doctor.

123
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,400
I'm afraid people's gonna come steal my things because I'm so rich.

124
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,080
Or even for Buddhists.

125
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,960
I'm a Buddhist.

126
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,280
I have high moral value.

127
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,280
Or I'm a great meditator.

128
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,720
You have an image.

129
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,240
Of a strong self.

130
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,640
But that's against the real teaching of Buddha.

131
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,360
So we all have the strong idea of me and the self.

132
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,040
There was a master.

133
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,320
One day he brought all his students up in the mountain.

134
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,720
And when they reached the top of the mountain.

135
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,000
There was a big tree.

136
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,520
The master went and hugged the tree really really tightly.

137
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,120
And he asked the student.

138
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,600
Please help pull me away from this tree.

139
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,640
I am stuck.

140
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,720
So all the students tried really hard.

141
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,000
To pull their master.

142
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,800
But the master has supernatural power.

143
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,200
All the students cannot move him at all.

144
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,560
After a long time.

145
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,000
They stopped trying.

146
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,920
And the master just let go.

147
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,080
And he was free.

148
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,640
He said to all his disciples.

149
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,880
We are all hugging the tree.

150
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,400
Hugging the ego.

151
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,600
Hugging the me.

152
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,560
And we're saying.

153
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,680
Why am I suffering so much with my life?

154
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,920
Because we are hugging the self.

155
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,840
That's why you have so much pain.

156
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,880
And so much sorrow.

157
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,800
And so much suffering.

158
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,160
So the image of the self is actually why we are suffering.

159
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,320
The second image is the image or the form of others.

160
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,240
Because there is a self.

161
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,760
We have the opposite.

162
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,200
Which are people that are different from my existence.

163
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,480
You have conflicts.

164
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,160
You have comparison.

165
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,680
You have envy.

166
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,080
Just look at brothers and sisters.

167
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,200
Who's prettier.

168
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,120
Who's doing better in school.

169
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,960
Or who does the parents love.

170
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,760
More.

171
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,480
Because we have the idea of others separating from us.

172
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,560
That's why we have jealousy.

173
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,080
That's why we have pride.

174
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,560
That's why we have so much suffering.

175
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,480
The idea of the self makes us have the idea of others.

176
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,880
So that we have a lot of conflicts.

177
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,320
The third is the form of a physical being.

178
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,560
This is talking about the physical existence.

179
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,240
The space that we're living in.

180
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,160
We always describe ourselves.

181
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,560
I am from what country and this is my house at this address.

182
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,920
We are very caught up in how we identify ourselves.

183
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:36,960
Our existence is not defined by our physical existence.

184
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,040
The space is not real.

185
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,560
It's an illusion.

186
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,760
Buddha talked about the six realms of reincarnation.

187
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,920
There are actually lots of ghosts.

188
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,920
There are actually heavenly beings.

189
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,400
There are 28 levels of heaven.

190
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,960
And there are actually Buddhas who are out of the six realms of reincarnation.

191
00:08:53,960 --> 00:09:00,880
If we see beyond the physical existence, we can see so much more.

192
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,960
There are actually a lot more out there that we don't even know.

193
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:10,080
If you can just break away from the concept of the physical being.

194
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,280
We have the concept about lifespan.

195
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,480
This is space.

196
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,760
This is time.

197
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,160
We're very caught up in the idea of time.

198
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,160
Everybody wants to have a long life.

199
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,960
When you're old, you talk about when you were young.

200
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,960
How great you were.

201
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,960
If you're a child, then you all dream about the future.

202
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,320
I'm going to be the president.

203
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,840
I'm going to be someone great.

204
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,720
You know, we're thinking about the past, thinking about the future.

205
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,960
The concept of time itself is an illusion.

206
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:42,960
If you can go into deep meditation, you will see your past lifetimes.

207
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,960
You might be able to see your future.

208
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,640
You can see a lot of things.

209
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:52,480
If you just let go the idea, the concept of time and lifespan.

210
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,840
We are all caught up.

211
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,840
In these four forms.

212
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,840
That's why we cannot see the truth.

213
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:05,840
Now to see these four forms as the six metaphors we just talked about.

214
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:13,840
For example, you should see the idea of the self as a dream, as a mirage, as a bubble,

215
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:18,840
as a shadow, as a door drop, as a flash of lightning.

216
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,840
Same as the image of others, image of physical beings.

217
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,840
The image of lifespan, the time.

218
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:33,840
It's all like a dream, a mirage, a bubble, a shadow, a door drop, and lightning.

219
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:41,840
If you can see everything in this matter, you have the unbreakable wisdom.

220
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,840
And you see what Buddha sees.

221
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,840
You can do a lot more for mankind.

222
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,840
Your life on this earth would be completely different.

223
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:57,840
Because you will be able to reach enlightenment and help everyone else reach enlightenment.

224
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:06,840
In conclusion, we should free ourselves from all attachments while mastering the mind.

225
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:12,840
The two big questions throughout the whole sutra is where should my heart reside?

226
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:18,840
And how do I master this wandering mind full of delusions?

227
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,840
The answer is simple.

228
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:25,840
Let go of all attachments to form an image.

229
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,840
See beyond the illusion.

230
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,840
Then you'll be able to master your mind naturally.

231
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:41,840
Because your true Buddha nature will come alive if you just let go of the concepts you're holding onto.

232
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,840
Let go of the big tree.

233
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,840
You are free.

234
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,840
Like an eagle up in the air.

235
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,840
Up in the sky.

236
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,840
You see the world much more clearly.

237
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:56,840
You can have this grand vision and see what other people cannot see.

238
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:05,840
Your happiness should not be depending on marriage or my success or my image of the self or in this space and time.

239
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,840
If you let it all go, your happiness is unbreakable.

240
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,840
The unbreakable wisdom is unbreakable happiness.

241
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,840
Happiness is inside within you.

242
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,840
Not the outside conditioned existence.

243
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,840
So this is the perfect wisdom.

244
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,840
This is how we get out of reincarnation.

245
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,840
For Pure Land Buddhist practitioners, it's very important.

246
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:39,840
You have to let go of this lifetime, this samsara life full of the self and the me.

247
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,840
You have the same unbreakable wisdom as Amitabha Buddha.

248
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,840
So sure enough, you'll definitely go to the Pure Land.

249
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,840
Pure Land and reach Buddhahood.

250
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,840
So that's the class for today.

251
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,840
Thank you for listening.

252
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,840
Amitabha.
