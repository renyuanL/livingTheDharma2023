1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Today we will talk about realization.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Buddha is the enlightened one who realized the truth about life and reached ultimate happiness.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
In this class, we will learn about what is realization.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This is a verse from the Eight Realizations Sutra.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It says,

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Realize that this world is impermanent, that nations are unsafe and unstable,

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
that the four elements cause suffering and are empty,

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
that there is no self within the five skandhas,

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
that all things that arise must change and decline,

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and that they are false appearances without any stable essence,

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
that the mind is a source of evil,

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and that the form is a congregation of wrongdoings.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Contemplate all of this,

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and gradually you will disentangle yourself from the cycle of birth and death.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I numbered them as ten lines.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Number one is realize that this world is impermanent.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
There are two kinds of impermanence.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
One is called the impermanence of continuance.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This is talking about our lifetime.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
In the continuity of life,

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
we must go through aging and decline.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
That is impermanence.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The other impermanence is called the subtle impermanence.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's talking about moment-to-moment impermanence.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Everything is causing conditions,

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
therefore the conditions are always changing,

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
so the world is constantly changing.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Just like two years ago,

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
we would never guess the world would be plagued by the coronavirus.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That is a big shock to us.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But if we really understand

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
that this virus is expounding the dharma of impermanence,

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
we will no longer be afraid.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We will accept this phenomenon

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and actively use this impermanence

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
to come into spiritual awakening.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So when we really realize impermanence,

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
it will help us sever our attachment to the mundane world,

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
and it will also bring our great compassion

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
to everyone who is suffering right now.

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Number two,

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
the nations of the world.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The nations are unsafe and unstable.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
All the countries right now are unsafe

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
because of the virus, the politics, and economics.

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Nobody is for sure.

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So when it's uncertain and unstable,

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
we feel suffering.

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But a person can still have inner peace

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
in a chaotic world.

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It just takes a lot of meditation and wisdom.

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
When we really understand impermanence,

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
we will accept the current condition

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and actually create positive condition

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
to benefit the world.

56
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Number three,

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
that the four elements cause suffering

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
and are empty.

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The four elements are earth, water, fire, and wind.

60
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
These four elements make up the world

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
and make up our body.

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Because they're conditioned existence,

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
they're always changing.

64
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
They cause suffering

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
and is empty in nature.

66
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
When we really let go of our attachment

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
to the four elements,

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
to our body,

69
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
then we will see our true nature.

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
In the Shogama Sutra, it says,

71
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
the nature of form is true emptiness,

72
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
and the nature of emptiness is true form.

73
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So when you let go of all your attachment

74
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
to form, to water, to fire, to wind,

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
then you will see your true essence.

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So in the sutra, it talks about

77
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
King Parson Nagya.

78
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
He was having a conversation with Buddha.

79
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Buddha asked him,

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
is your body indestructible

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
or is subject to decay?

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The king replied,

83
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
this body of mine will constantly change

84
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
until it perish.

85
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Buddha said, so it is.

86
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You are in your declining years.

87
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
How do you look compared to when you were a boy?

88
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Because now the king is 62,

89
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
the same age as Buddha.

90
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The king replied,

91
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
when I was a boy,

92
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
my skin was fresh and smooth,

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
but now my hair is white

94
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
and my face is wrinkled.

95
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Buddha said, did this happen suddenly?

96
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The king replied, no,

97
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
it's subtle transformation.

98
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It happened decade by decade,

99
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
year by year,

100
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
month by month,

101
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
day by day,

102
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
instant by instant,

103
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
and thought by thought.

104
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I know my body will keep changing

105
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
until it's extinct.

106
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
But Buddha said,

107
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
your face is wrinkled,

108
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
but your nature is not wrinkled.

109
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What wrinkles is subject to change,

110
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
what does not wrinkle does not change.

111
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Your nature is fundamentally free

112
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
from production and extinction.

113
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Therefore, it's not subject to birth or death.

114
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The king heard this,

115
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
really believed in it,

116
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
and he felt this great delight and dharma joy

117
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
because he does not have to be afraid of death anymore.

118
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
When you see suffering and emptiness in the form,

119
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
that's when you find

120
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
your true nature.

121
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Number four,

122
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
that there is no self within the five skandhas.

123
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The five skandhas are

124
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
our form,

125
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
our feelings,

126
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
our perception,

127
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
mental formation,

128
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
and consciousness.

129
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So the body and mind,

130
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
there is no self.

131
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Everyone is clinging to the five aggregates

132
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
as the self,

133
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
but it's actually not.

134
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So we have to see emptiness

135
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
and relinquish.

136
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Only when we relinquish our attachment

137
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
to the five aggregates

138
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
can we be free from suffering

139
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
because attaching to the five aggregates

140
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
is causing the suffering

141
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
and the reincarnation.

142
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So we need to understand non-self.

143
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The five aggregates is not me.

144
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
There was a 50-year-old patient.

145
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Her stomach was bleeding,

146
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
so the doctors had to use a feeding tube through her nose.

147
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And because the hospital was too crowded,

148
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
she had to sleep in the hallway.

149
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And when people sleep in the hallway,

150
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
they always have to hear lots of complaints.

151
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
But this woman is a devout Buddhist.

152
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
In the morning, she woke up.

153
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
She told the doctor,

154
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
good morning, doctor.

155
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The air is great in this hospital.

156
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I already finished my morning recitation

157
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
and I'm very happy.

158
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
The doctor was very surprised to hear that from her

159
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
because she has a feeding tube through her nose

160
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
and she's in the hallway.

161
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
But she was so cheerful and happy.

162
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
After the exam, the doctor told her,

163
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
you actually have late stage liver cancer.

164
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
This lady was still smiling and said calmly,

165
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
if I live for one day,

166
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I will serve Amitabha and serve others.

167
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And when it's time for me to go,

168
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Amitabha will come take me.

169
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So she was calm when she heard the diagnosis.

170
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Many months after she was supposed to die,

171
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
the doctor called and asked about her.

172
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Surprisingly, she is still healthy,

173
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
still going to other temples,

174
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
helping out everyone learn Buddhism,

175
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
and is still spreading hope and love to everybody.

176
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So this is a Bodhisattva that understands no self.

177
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
She let go of her attachment to her body

178
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
and to her ego.

179
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
All she does is to serve others.

180
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
That is a true Bodhisattva.

181
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
These four, truth, impermanence, suffering,

182
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
emptiness, and non-self,

183
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
we need to contemplate in order to come to

184
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
true realization about suffering,

185
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
the first noble truth.

186
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The next lines further explain these four truths.

187
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Number five, that all things that arise

188
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
must change and decline.

189
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
We talk about everything in terms of its changes.

190
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So it goes through our thoughts arising,

191
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
abiding, changing, and declining.

192
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Our body goes through birth, aging, sickness, and death.

193
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And the world goes through formation, existence,

194
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
disintegration, and emptiness.

195
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So everything goes through cycles.

196
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
This is just telling us it's impermanent

197
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
and it's causing suffering.

198
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So this is describing number one,

199
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
impermanence, in detail.

200
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You might ask, what is wrong with arising

201
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
or with birth?

202
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
We actually like birth.

203
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Birth is actually the biggest culprit of suffering.

204
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And the sutra, it gives a metaphor of four robbers.

205
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
There were four robbers that were trying to rob this person.

206
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So one of the robbers disguised as a very nice person

207
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
to lure the person to come out.

208
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
When the person comes out,

209
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
the three other robbers

210
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
attack the person.

211
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So the first robber that's disguised

212
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
is actually birth.

213
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And the other three are aging, sickness, and death.

214
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So when we have arising,

215
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
there must be ceasing.

216
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That is impermanence.

217
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Number six,

218
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
and that they are false appearances

219
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
without any stable essence.

220
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
False appearances is talking about suffering.

221
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And without any stable essence

222
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
is talking about emptiness.

223
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Everything you see is a false appearance.

224
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
We are being deceived by ourselves.

225
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
We are actually the person

226
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
that is causing the cage of reincarnation.

227
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And we don't even know.

228
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Just like all the virtual reality rides

229
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
in the amusement park.

230
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's just a projection with special effect

231
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
that we think is so real and so fun.

232
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But it's actually a delusion.

233
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
This life is full of false appearances.

234
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Do not be attached to them.

235
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
When you're attached,

236
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
you don't see the truth.

237
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Without any stable essence,

238
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
which means everything is empty in nature.

239
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
That means it doesn't have a permanent,

240
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
independent, and controlling self nature.

241
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Number seven and eight,

242
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
that the mind is the source of evil

243
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
and that the form is a congregation

244
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
of wrong doings.

245
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
This is talking about number four,

246
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
which is non-self.

247
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Our body and mind is not the real us.

248
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
If it's the real us,

249
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
why do we have so many evil thoughts

250
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
and wrong doings?

251
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
If we can control it,

252
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
why will we create negative karma for ourselves?

253
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So it's actually all conditioned seeds

254
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
from our elia consciousness

255
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
that's causing us to be more deluded

256
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
and keep creating reincarnation for ourselves.

257
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
So realize that your mind and body

258
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
is not the real you.

259
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Let go of your self ego.

260
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
That's the only way to cultivate.

261
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
If you keep cultivating

262
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
and you still hold on to the self,

263
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
we will never succeed.

264
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Just like if you go up to the mountain

265
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
and hide there to be in solitude

266
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
and meditate,

267
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
but you still hold on to the self,

268
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
it's still useless cultivation.

269
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So let go of the self.

270
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
That's the most important realization.

271
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Contemplate all of this,

272
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
impermanence,

273
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
suffering,

274
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
emptiness,

275
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
and non-self.

276
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And gradually,

277
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
you will disentangle yourself

278
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
from the cycle of birth and death.

279
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You keep realizing these four truths,

280
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
you'll be free from birth and death,

281
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
which means reincarnation.

282
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
So when you really understand this,

283
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
you will be a true bodhisattva

284
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
who will make the bodhisattva vow

285
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
to endure suffering

286
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
on behalf of all sentient beings.

287
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So do not ask for

288
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
a certain enlightenment.

289
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Just look at your life right now.

290
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
See the impermanence,

291
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
suffering,

292
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
emptiness,

293
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
and non-self

294
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
in your current life.

295
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And you will find your true nature.

296
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
We call it the real mark.

297
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
When you really see clearly,

298
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
you will be at peace with yourself

299
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
and your life.

300
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Then you can influence everyone around you

301
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
to be peaceful and happy.

302
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That is a true realized buddhist.

303
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
So that's the class for today.

304
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Thank you for listening.

305
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Amitabha.
