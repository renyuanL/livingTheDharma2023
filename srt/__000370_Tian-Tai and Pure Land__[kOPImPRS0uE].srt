1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,920
Today we are going to talk about Tien Tai and Pure Land.

2
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:27,000
The Knight Patriarch of Pure Land Buddhism, Master Ou Yi, wrote a commentary on the Amitabha

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,760
Sutra using Tien Tai Buddhism to explain Pure Land Buddhism.

4
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:38,320
We will discuss the relationship between Tien Tai and Pure Land.

5
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:46,860
The Tien Tai Buddhism was founded by Master Zhi Yi based on this verse from Bodhisattva

6
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:47,860
Nagarjuna.

7
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:55,500
It says, For dharmas arising from conditions, I affirm that they are empty.

8
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,500
They are conventional.

9
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,600
But yet indicate the meaning of the middle way.

10
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:09,340
All dharmas arise from conditions arising, cause and effect, thus the basis for everything

11
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,580
in this universe, including our body, including our family, including everything that we see

12
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,580
in this world.

13
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,740
They are all conditioned, means they are forever changing.

14
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,740
It's impermanent.

15
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,840
Therefore, I affirm that they are empty.

16
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,640
Because they are changing, there is not an intrinsic nature in any of the conditioned

17
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,640
dharma.

18
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:41,360
We should not be attached to anything, including the idea of the self, or anything that appears

19
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,880
in our lives in this world.

20
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:50,540
They are all illusory appearance based on the cause and conditions.

21
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,740
Everything cannot stand alone by itself.

22
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,740
Everything can only exist by itself.

23
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,740
Everything can only exist by itself.

24
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:59,600
Everything is interdependent and everything is forever changing.

25
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,940
Everything is impermanent.

26
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,880
We call it empty.

27
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:10,160
We often say to surpass passion and depart from discrimination.

28
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:17,660
That's how we actually let go of the attachment to the self and attachment to all dharmas.

29
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,140
So emptiness is the basis of enlightenment.

30
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,640
They are conventional.

31
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:31,060
It means even though everything is empty, they do have a temporary provincial existence.

32
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,400
We still live on this earth.

33
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:40,700
We must use this life to be a true bodhisattva, give everybody the best we got, and be full

34
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:45,460
of love, compassion, kindness, and joy.

35
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,640
Spread our love to all sentient beings.

36
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,640
That is a true bodhisattva.

37
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:59,540
Focus on what's in the conventional world without any attachment to the world, but yet

38
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,160
indicate the meaning of the middle way.

39
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:10,000
Middle means we are balanced between the ultimate truth and the conventional truth.

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,220
That's our true Buddha nature, the basis of all our cultivation.

41
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:20,320
And that is the basis of Tantide Buddhism.

42
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,520
From these four lines,

43
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:29,540
Master Zhi Yi categorized all Buddha's teachings into four doctrines of conversion.

44
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:34,440
The first teaching is called the Tripitaka teaching.

45
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,920
This is the Theravada Buddhism.

46
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:45,060
Their concept is focused on all conditioned arisings, such as the Four Noble Truths and

47
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,320
the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination.

48
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,540
They believe everything is really arising.

49
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:59,540
Really ceasing, this life and death, this samsara, this nirvana, it's really happening.

50
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:05,160
That's why they try very hard to sever from the cycle of life and birth.

51
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:10,080
This is called the Rising and Ceasing Four Noble Truths.

52
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:17,800
The Four Noble Truths are suffering, cause of suffering, cessation of suffering, way

53
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,800
to end suffering.

54
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,800
These are the Four Noble Truths.

55
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
The Four Noble Truths are suffering, cause of suffering, cessation of suffering, way

56
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,500
to end suffering.

57
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,640
The Four Noble Truths are suffering, cause of suffering, cessation of suffering, way to

58
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,640
end suffering.

59
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,640
These are the Four Noble Truths taught by Buddha.

60
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:32,540
For the Theravada Buddha, all things are conditioned rising and conditioned ceasing.

61
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,000
To them, it's really happening.

62
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,360
In reality, there is samsara, there is nirvana.

63
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:47,260
So that's what they base their meditation on, to end the suffering of samsara.

64
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,540
The second teaching is called Common Teaching.

65
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,540
Common Teaching is the teaching of the Three Wisdoms.

66
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,540
Common Teaching is the teaching of the Three Wisdoms.

67
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,540
Common Teaching is the teaching of the Three Wisdoms.

68
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,540
Common Teaching is the teaching of the Three Wisdoms.

69
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:57,820
They are very common to Theravada and Common to Mahayana Bodhisattvas.

70
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:02,060
So there's higher level of emptiness.

71
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,260
We understand everything, conditioned arising.

72
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:09,200
They are not really rising or ceasing.

73
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:16,440
Therefore Four Noble Truths are called Non-Arising Four Noble Truths.

74
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,960
This is a higher level of emptiness.

75
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,520
There is nothing really rising.

76
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:32,120
or ceasing. Everything does not exist by itself, nor by other causes, nor jointly with other

77
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:42,040
causes, nor without causes. Thus, it is known to be non-existent. There are four deductive

78
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:50,220
reasonings here. We should think everything is not really arising or ceasing at all. For

79
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:59,680
example, if we have anger, we should use this deductive reasoning. First, where does anger

80
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:07,620
come from? Is this anger arising by itself? If it is, then we should be angry all the

81
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:15,420
time. So that can be right. Number two, is it because of his words or other people's

82
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:20,080
words that make you angry? If that is the case, then everything is not really arising

83
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,180
at all. So that can be right. Number two, is it because of his words or other people's

84
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:20,200
words that make you angry? If that is the case, then everything is not really arising

85
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:31,080
at all. So that can be right. Number three, is it causes joined together that make you

86
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:38,800
angry right now? No, because two things cannot be combined to create. Therefore, it can be

87
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:46,640
right either. Number four, is it without a cause? You just become angry for no reason.

88
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,180
That can be it either. Conclusion, thus, it is not a cause, it is a result. So that can

89
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:59,960
it is known to be non-existent. This anger never arise, never cease. You should just

90
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:06,680
let it go. It never happened and it doesn't affect your Buddha nature at all. This is

91
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:15,180
how we should contemplate all the time in order to have this Prajna of emptiness.

92
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:22,680
The third teaching is called the Distinctive Teaching. This is tailored for Bodhisattvas.

93
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:29,980
Not only do they know emptiness and let go of their attachment, they also focus on what's

94
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:38,340
going on in the world. They understand the immeasurable Four Noble Truths. The Ten Dharma

95
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:44,980
Realms have different sufferings. Everyone is an incarnation, their immeasurable number

96
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,080
is one. Everyone is an incarnation, their immeasurable number is one. Everyone is an

97
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,160
immeasurable number is one. Everyone is an incarnation, their immeasurable number is

98
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,340
one. Everyone is an incarnation, their immeasurable number is one. Who cares about what happens

99
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,720
to any one others chew and drink. They don't care about anyата, that is immeasurable.

100
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,800
Bodhisattvas know that minimal consumer Auto-Saltra also understands toma all sufferings,

101
00:07:51,800 --> 00:08:12,060
is the

102
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,600
ultimate convinced progress.

103
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:14,960
Rub трав

104
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:22,620
Buddhism is all about the complete round teaching. It's all inclusive teaching.

105
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,680
Nothing really matters anymore. Everything that's going on in the world

106
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:34,820
is already your Buddha nature. Samsara is your Buddha nature. Nirvana is your Buddha

107
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:41,140
nature. Nothing is of any difference. Sentient beings and Buddha are the same.

108
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:47,200
It's called the non-doing for noble truth. There's nothing for you to do.

109
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:53,380
There's no suffering to depart from. There's no Nirvana to gain. It's already

110
00:08:53,380 --> 00:09:00,520
your Buddha nature. It's just right here and right now in your one true mind. This

111
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:07,940
is our true suchness. This is all that matters. So we call it one color, one

112
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,040
smell. Everything is the middle.

113
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:18,360
Any smell, any color, all dharmas in the world is already the Buddha.

114
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:24,900
Because your mind is the Buddha. You don't have to try so hard to be out of

115
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:30,040
suffering. You are already out of suffering because you are the Buddha. So

116
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:35,860
that's the ten type teaching based on the Lotus Sutra. Because of these four

117
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,640
types of teaching, we have the four Pure Lands of

118
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,140
Buddha.

119
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:48,580
the Amitabha's Western Pure Land. We are studying Pure Land Buddhism where we chant

120
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:55,860
Amitabha Buddha's name, hoping to go to his world of ultimate bliss. Every Buddha's

121
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:04,280
land has four different types of lands based on the four teachings. The first land is Together

122
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:12,160
Dwelling Pure Land, where the ordinary beings and saints live together because we have not

123
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:19,420
ended our afflictions yet. That's why we dwell in this land. So this is about rising and

124
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:27,940
seizing Four Noble Truth. When we are still in the samsara, so by chanting the name Amitabha,

125
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:34,260
even if we haven't ended our afflictions, we can still go to this land.

126
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:40,900
where the saints and the ordinary beings live together because of our Buddha nature.

127
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:49,780
We will end reincarnation forever and we will never retrogress just by chanting the name Amitabha.

128
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:54,900
The second land is the land of expedient liberation.

129
00:10:54,900 --> 00:11:00,820
That's the art hats, they already severed the idea of the self

130
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:07,380
and they are learning the common teaching to gain higher wisdom of emptiness.

131
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:13,460
They can go further to the third land, the land of real reward.

132
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:20,260
All the enlightened Bodhisattvas they live in this land of real reward.

133
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:24,180
It's beautiful land full of all the goodness, merit.

134
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:29,140
They are in this conventional world, trying to save sentient beings.

135
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,740
The last land is the land of meditation.

136
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:30,760
The second land is called what we call Sun ребята.

137
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:30,800
Sun.

138
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:30,820
Sun.

139
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:38,880
land of eternal still light. This land is where Amitabha resides. In this land, there's

140
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:46,880
actually no form, nothing at all. It's just the Buddha nature. We call it eternal because

141
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:54,160
the Buddha nature never ends, never dies, never moves, and it's still without any wandering

142
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:01,860
thoughts, without any chaos, and it's full of light, bright, illuminating, and shiny.

143
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:08,840
That's what our Buddha nature is like. So this is where all Buddhas reside. So if you

144
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:16,140
can understand these four types of teaching based on the Tantide Buddhism, you will know

145
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:23,420
which land you will be going to. What is so special about Amitabha's Pure Land? That's

146
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:23,920
different from Amitabha's Pure Land. That's different from Amitabha's Pure Land. That's

147
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,140
different from Amitabha's Pure Land. That's different from Amitabha's Pure Land. That's

148
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,120
different from Amitabha's Pure Land. That's really misshapen for me. What I don't like

149
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:32,320
about other Buddhas' land is that this together dwelling Pure Land in Amitabha's Pure Land.

150
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:41,360
They are horizontal with the upper lands. We all dwell together in Amitabha's Western

151
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:48,120
Pure Land. Us mundane people can be with the合伯 米 , the Bodisattvas 谷身佛 ,

152
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:53,900
and the Buddha in the same space. That's why it's the easiest, the fastest way to

153
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:59,420
for us to become enlightened and reach Buddhahood because you are with these

154
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:06,500
people who are enlightened in conclusion complete principle accomplishing

155
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:14,920
practice complete practice demonstrating the principle the principle is the

156
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:21,680
ultimate truth the emptiness the practice is the conventional truth where

157
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:29,000
we have real physical practice this can be chanting Amitabha this can be our six

158
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,720
pyramidas it can be any of our practice the complete principle of the one true

159
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:43,700
mind when we dwell in our perfect nature we will accomplish all our practice just

160
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:49,860
one chanting of Amitabha you are already the Buddha because we have the principle

161
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,680
we have the Buddha nature

162
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:58,400
to begin with any practice is a way to reach Buddhahood because we have it

163
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:05,680
originally vice versa all our practice is to show that we have the Buddha

164
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:12,700
nature the Buddha nature is our practice the practice is our Buddha nature

165
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:18,260
everything that you do even if you're sweeping the floor even if you're

166
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,620
washing dishes that can all be your practice

167
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:28,280
because one color one smell it's already the middle way so any of your

168
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:33,860
practice is for you to go to the Western pure land there's noведmondo

169
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:40,000
obstruction between the principle and the practice or we say thevic retour

170
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,960
numina and the phenomena or between our heart and

171
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:51,520
what is going on in the world that way you know how to live the slide by being a

172
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:57,960
empty, not attached to anyone or anything but love or sentient beings and give the best

173
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:04,660
that you have in this lifetime. At the end of our life, we will go to Amitabha's Western

174
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:11,200
Pure Land. There is a woman, she hated her husband. Her hatred was so strong, she grew

175
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:18,420
a lesion on her back. One day, she came to realization, I cannot live like this anymore.

176
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:25,600
So she made a clear-cut decision. I will only have love toward my husband. We will live

177
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:33,840
in harmony, peace, and kindness. From that day on, she never complained. She only exalted

178
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:40,740
his greatness. Three weeks later, she went back to the doctor. Her lesion was all gone.

179
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:48,400
There was no more. Why is that? Because the principle. We have the Buddha nature. It's

180
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:54,700
you just have a kind heart, then anything can happen in the physical world, in the world

181
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:59,340
of the phenomenon, because everything is based on our heart.

182
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:09,620
So detached from the idea of the self, detached from all our opinions and judgment of others,

183
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:17,900
only have love and kindness in this conventional world, then you are likely to align with all

184
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,380
Buddhas.

185
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:24,580
And go to Amitabha's Western Pure Land. So that's the class for today. Thank you for

186
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,860
listening. Amitabha.
