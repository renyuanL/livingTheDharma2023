1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,360
Today we're going to talk about pure mind, pure land.

2
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,400
How do we take rebirth in Amitabha's pure land?

3
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,840
We must have a pure mind.

4
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,620
The pure mind is without afflictions and without attachments.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,840
It is our true mind, the compassionate mind.

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,840
Today we will use three sutras to describe this pure mind.

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,000
The Mimalakirti Sutra, the Awakening of Faith in Mahayana,

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Shastra, and the Contemplation Sutra.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,760
It talks about three kinds of mind in all these three sutras.

10
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,240
Let's first talk about the Mimalakirti Sutra.

11
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:05,740
It says bodhisattva can create their buddha field or their buddha land.

12
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:10,740
What kind of bodhisattva will create what kind of world?

13
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:16,240
For example, a bodhisattva with a mind of positive thoughts,

14
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:27,240
when he attains enlightenment, living beings free of hypocrisy and deceit will be born in his buddha field.

15
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,240
A bodhisattva's mind is always positive.

16
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:37,240
He will not have anyone who comes and be negative and deceiving.

17
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,740
If a bodhisattva has the mind of high resolve,

18
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:47,740
which means he really wants to be awakened and not be deluded anymore.

19
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,740
When he attains enlightenment,

20
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:55,740
living beings who have harvest merits and virtues because of their high resolve

21
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,740
will be born in his buddha field.

22
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:05,240
Lastly, if a bodhisattva has the mind of virtuous application,

23
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,240
when he attains enlightenment,

24
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:14,240
living beings lived by all virtuous principles will be born in his buddha land.

25
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,240
So what kind of people are surrounding us?

26
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,240
It's all because of our mind.

27
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,240
If we are always generous,

28
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:27,240
we will attract generous people into our world.

29
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,240
If we are always patient,

30
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,240
we will attract people that are tolerant in our world.

31
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,240
If we are always angry,

32
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,240
then we attract bitter people in our world.

33
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,240
It's all tantamount to our own mind.

34
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,740
Nothing is beyond this cause and effect.

35
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,240
The cause is our mind.

36
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,240
So we should reside in our pure mind.

37
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,240
Shri Puta heard this.

38
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,240
He thought to himself,

39
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,240
Oh Shakyamuni Buddha,

40
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,240
the Buddha of the Saha world,

41
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,240
he must have some impure mind

42
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,240
because the world is so corrupted and impure,

43
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,240
our world right now.

44
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,740
Then Buddha put his foot and his toe on the ground.

45
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,240
All of a sudden,

46
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,240
Shri Puta, he sees the world that Buddha sees.

47
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,240
Amazingly,

48
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,240
the world is without any darkness

49
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,240
or corruption.

50
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,240
It's perfectly pure.

51
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:34,240
Then he realized it's the mind of his that is impure,

52
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,240
not the world.

53
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,240
Now let's talk about the awakening of faith

54
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:45,240
in Mahayana by Bodhisattva Asvagosha.

55
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:50,240
He said we must cultivate the same three minds.

56
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,240
First, we must cultivate the straightforward mind.

57
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:59,240
Correctly meditate on the principle of suchness.

58
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:04,240
Therefore, straightforward means without any impurity.

59
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:09,240
Honestly, meditate on your true nature,

60
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,240
the true suchness.

61
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,240
Then we must have the mind of profoundness

62
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,240
deep inside of our heart.

63
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,240
It's not attached to the worldly experience,

64
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,240
only reside in our true nature.

65
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,240
That's most profound.

66
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,240
There is no limit to the joyful accumulation

67
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,240
of all kinds of goodness.

68
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,240
Our true nature is perfectly pure in its essential nature,

69
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,240
but now we are full of defilements and impurities.

70
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,240
We must clean off these impurities by constant cultivation.

71
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,240
Get rid of our greed, anger, ignorance,

72
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,240
and attachment, delusion about the world.

73
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,240
Lastly, we must have the mind of great compassion.

74
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,240
Great compassion is the mind of the Buddha.

75
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,240
How do we know if we have the Buddha mind?

76
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,240
When we have unconditional compassion,

77
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,240
loving kindness for all sentient beings.

78
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,240
The sixth patriarch of Zen Buddhism,

79
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,240
Hui Nan,

80
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,240
when he was first given the bowl

81
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,240
and the robe by the fifth patriarch,

82
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,240
people were jealous of him, chasing him.

83
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,240
He had to hide for fifteen whole years.

84
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,240
He actually hid in a party of hunters.

85
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,240
Occasionally, he would preach to them

86
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,240
in a way that befitted their understanding.

87
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,240
Sometimes they would ask him to watch their net.

88
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,240
When he sees like creatures,

89
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,240
he would set them free.

90
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,240
When he cooked the meat in the pan,

91
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,240
he would only eat the vegetables.

92
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,240
Because he is a bodhisattva with great compassion,

93
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,240
he's able to endure this kind of life for fifteen years.

94
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,240
He doesn't have any affliction.

95
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,240
He doesn't feel suffering.

96
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:18,240
He's completely pure and perfect in this kind of situation.

97
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,240
As long as we have the pure mind,

98
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,240
the living environment would be pure.

99
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,240
Lastly, the Contemplation Sutra.

100
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,240
This is really a Pure Land Sutra.

101
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,240
It says we must also have these three minds.

102
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,240
First, we must have the most sincere mind.

103
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,240
When we chant Amitabha,

104
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,240
we should have the utmost sincerity.

105
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,240
This sincerity also means

106
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,240
we sincerely respect all sentient beings.

107
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,240
Because all sentient beings are future Buddhas.

108
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:00,240
Do you respect all people around you as Buddhas?

109
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,240
That's how a true cultivator of Pure Land Buddhism should be.

110
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:10,240
Master Daozhen, she was a doctor when she was young.

111
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,240
One day, a felon was in the hospital

112
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,240
who was involved in a gunshot.

113
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,240
Everybody was talking about him,

114
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,240
but he was not her patient.

115
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,240
While waiting for a patient's report,

116
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,240
she started doing her evening recitation.

117
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,240
After she finished,

118
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,240
she prayed for this felon with the gunshot.

119
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,240
After she opened her eyes,

120
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,240
she noticed that felon was calling her.

121
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,240
He said,

122
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,240
You come help me and be my doctor.

123
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,240
I am in great pain.

124
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,240
My mind is very depressed and chaotic.

125
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,240
The doctor said,

126
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,240
I understand.

127
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,240
I would be too if I were you.

128
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,240
I am a Buddhist.

129
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,240
Whenever I am sad and bitter,

130
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,240
I chant Amitabha.

131
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,240
It always calms me down.

132
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,240
Amitabha is most compassionate and equal.

133
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,240
Chanting his name brings out our Buddha nature

134
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,240
that is within all of us.

135
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,240
She gave him a picture of the Buddha

136
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,240
and a chanting bee.

137
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,240
The next day she came.

138
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,240
Much to her surprise,

139
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,240
the Buddha picture was stuck on the wall

140
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,240
of the patient in the next bed.

141
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,240
This gunshot patient said to her,

142
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,240
I thought the new patient needs the Buddha picture

143
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,240
and the Buddha bee more than I do.

144
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,240
So I gave them to him.

145
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,240
Can you please give me another Buddha bee?

146
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,240
She was so touched.

147
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,240
Because he is already a bodhisattva

148
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,240
trying to save others.

149
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,240
She actually gave him her own chanting bee.

150
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,240
One day the doctor was walking up the stairs

151
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,240
in the hospital.

152
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,240
She saw the back of two men.

153
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,240
One is a police officer.

154
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,240
One is this patient.

155
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,240
His feet in chain,

156
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,240
but his hands was holding

157
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,240
the Buddha bee that she gave him.

158
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,240
She paid respect to him.

159
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,240
She knew that he did not need the chain anymore

160
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,240
because his feet are already stepping

161
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,240
on pure lotus flowers.

162
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,240
The pure mind of the doctor

163
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,240
saved this person's heart.

164
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,240
No matter where he is,

165
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,240
he is with Amitabha.

166
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,240
So when we have the utmost sincere mind,

167
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,240
we can touch the lives

168
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,240
of everybody in our lives.

169
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,240
Then we should have the mind of deep faith,

170
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,240
deep faith in Amitabha

171
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,240
and our true nature.

172
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,240
Think all the time that I have created

173
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,240
immeasurable evil karma

174
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,240
in all my lives of reincarnation.

175
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,240
If such karma has formed

176
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,240
the empty space in ten directions

177
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,240
will not contain it.

178
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,240
Now I am lucky.

179
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,240
I am a human who have heard the Dharma.

180
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,240
I should single-mindedly chant Amitabha,

181
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,240
see creepers in the pure land.

182
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,240
Otherwise, I will keep reincarnating

183
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,240
in the sixth path

184
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,240
and immense sea of suffering

185
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,240
without a way of liberation.

186
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,240
We should really have deep faith

187
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,240
in Amitabha

188
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,240
and Pure Land Buddhism.

189
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,240
Mostly, we have to have deep faith

190
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,240
in our true nature

191
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
like the precious mirror.

192
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,240
The mirror is now dirty.

193
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,240
We need to polish off all the dust.

194
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,240
That's all our afflictions and attachments.

195
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,240
Then it will be clean.

196
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,240
It will reflect everything clearly.

197
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,240
Lastly, we should aspire rebirth

198
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,240
by transferring merits.

199
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,240
Do not chant Amitabha

200
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,240
seeking rebirth for ourselves.

201
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,240
Every Amitabha is for all sentient beings.

202
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,240
We have this way of transferring

203
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,240
our merits to all sentient beings

204
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,240
in the Dharma realm

205
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,240
because they are all suffering,

206
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,240
all suffering and reincarnating.

207
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,240
That's the heart of a Buddha,

208
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,240
same as the great compassionate heart.

209
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,240
This is what our Buddha mind,

210
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,240
our Bodhi mind looks like.

211
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,240
In Tantide Buddhism,

212
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,240
it's called the threefold contemplation

213
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,240
in one mind.

214
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,240
Threefold contemplation,

215
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,240
the void meditation,

216
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,240
unreal meditation,

217
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,240
and mean meditation.

218
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,240
All contain in our one true mind.

219
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,240
Void meditation is understanding

220
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,240
the emptiness of all things.

221
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,240
When we have high resolve,

222
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,240
want to be liberated,

223
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,240
seeing things clearly,

224
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,240
not be deluded

225
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,240
and confused by the world,

226
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,240
we have the profound mind

227
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,240
to be liberated.

228
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,240
And we have deep faith

229
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,240
in our true nature.

230
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,240
When we deal with our personal affairs

231
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,240
and business,

232
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,240
we should have high watchfulness,

233
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,240
not be swayed or confused

234
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,240
by the external conditions.

235
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,240
If we are having favorable conditions,

236
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,240
we are not attached.

237
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,240
In unfavorable conditions,

238
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,240
we are not angry.

239
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,240
Then we want to have the unreal meditation,

240
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,240
which means we still have

241
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,240
an unreal existence in the world.

242
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,240
Even though everything is empty in nature,

243
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,240
but we still have a life to live.

244
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,240
Life of a Bodhisattva

245
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,240
is to have virtue,

246
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,240
great compassion,

247
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,240
and chant for all sentient beings.

248
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,240
Balance, emptiness,

249
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,240
and existence,

250
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,240
then it's the middle way,

251
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,240
the mean.

252
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,240
Then that's the mind

253
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,240
of pure positive thoughts,

254
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,240
straightforward mind,

255
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,240
and most sincere mind.

256
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,240
Why do we have to wait

257
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,240
until our life is up

258
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,240
to go to the pure land?

259
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,240
It's just now having the three minds

260
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,240
or one mind.

261
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,240
Chanting Amitabha,

262
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,240
it is already the pure land

263
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,240
right here,

264
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,240
right now.

265
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,240
Our lotus flower

266
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,240
is already full bloom.

267
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,240
Now it's the new year's.

268
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,240
Hope everyone will make the resolve

269
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,240
to build a pure land

270
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,240
in your life right now.

271
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,240
Then you'll definitely

272
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,240
go to Amitabha's

273
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,240
western pure land

274
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,240
because your mind is in

275
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,240
accordance with Amitabha's mind.

276
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,240
In conclusion,

277
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,240
it is your mind

278
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,240
that becomes a Buddha.

279
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,240
Nay, it is your mind

280
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,240
that is indeed

281
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,240
Buddha.

282
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,240
Buddha

283
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,240
is not Amitabha

284
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,240
saving us.

285
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,240
That's outside of our mind.

286
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,240
The Buddha

287
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,240
is you.

288
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,240
When you have this mind,

289
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,240
the pure mind,

290
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,240
the pure Buddha essence,

291
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,240
the pure self nature,

292
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,240
you are the Buddha.

293
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,240
It is your mind

294
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,240
that is indeed

295
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,240
Buddha.

296
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,240
So that's the class for today.

297
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,240
Thank you for listening.

298
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,240
Amitabha.
