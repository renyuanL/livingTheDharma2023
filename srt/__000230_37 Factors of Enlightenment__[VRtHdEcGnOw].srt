00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Today we are going to talk about 37 Factors of Enlightenment.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This is the jewel of cultivation in Buddhism.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
No matter if you are a Chen Buddhist, a Pure Land practitioner,

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
or you study Mahayana Buddhism or Theravada Buddhism,

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
we all have to learn the 37 Factors of Enlightenment.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It might sound like a lot, but it's actually lots of repeats and only 7 categories.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Four Mindfulness, Four Right Efforts, Four Miraculous Feats, Five Faculties, Five Powers,

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Seven Elements of Enlightenment, and Eightfold Path.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Let's first talk about the Four Mindfulness.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Number one, be mindful of our body.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Especially young people, we are very attached to our sensual desire,

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
contemplate on the impurity of our body and the body of others.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Everything from our body is filthy inside.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Do not be attached to our sensual desires.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Number two is mindful of our feelings.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Older people are more attached to their feelings,

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
so do not say anything wrong to old people, they remember forever.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
But Buddha tells us all feelings end up to be suffering,

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
because pleasant feeling, when it subsides, it becomes unsatisfying.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It becomes unsatisfactory and becomes pain.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So do not be attached to our feelings.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Number three is mindful of our mind.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Intellectuals and scholars, we are attached to our mind,

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
what we think is right, and we are always full of our opinions.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Buddha says to contemplate on the impermanence of our mind.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
All our thoughts are constantly changing from when we're young to when we're old.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Don't rely on your thoughts.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Our thoughts go through stages.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Rising, abiding, changing, and ceasing.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So nothing is permanent.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Don't rely on your thoughts.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Number four is phenomena.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Everything other than body, feeling, and mind, we call it phenomena.

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Contemplate on non-self of all phenomena.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
There's not a permanent, independent, controlling self that is experiencing the world,

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
like what we're thinking.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So our ego and our identity of the self

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
is actually an illusion.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's why we have all the problems and all the emotional suffering

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
because we have a strong identity that we think is the true self.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
If you can realize that there is actually no self,

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
then you will be liberated and be free from suffering.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So contemplate on the body, feeling, mind, and phenomena.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
This is a cultivation of great wisdom.

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Next, we have four right efforts.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
As a Buddhist, our duty is to make ourselves improve spiritually

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
and cultivate our virtues and ethics.

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Number one, non-virtue arises.

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We need to get rid of it right away.

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Non-virtues include negative emotions,

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
such as fear or anxiety or bitterness.

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Realize they are non-virtues.

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Get rid of them immediately

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
and go back to our positive, happy, and pleasant self.

55
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Number two is non-virtue not yet arises.

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
If you see non-virtue in others,

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
cutting a line or jumping through loopholes,

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
we do not want to follow.

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Number three is virtue arises.

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
We want it to maintain and grow.

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
For example, if we already vowed to be a great bodhisattva

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
to love and help all sentient beings,

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
we want that bodhi resolve to grow.

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Just like we're rising the bread dough,

65
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
we want it to grow bigger and bigger.

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Number four, virtue not yet arises.

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
If there's some good virtue you haven't put into practice,

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
you want to do it right now.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Maybe talk to that neighbor you never talked to before

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
or open up to that relative or a friend that did you wrong.

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
A lot of people think Buddhists are very pessimistic.

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Everything's about suffering and pain and letting go.

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But actually, we're very proactive in changing our bad ways

74
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
and making this a better world.

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Then we focus on the four miraculous feats.

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
This is concentration.

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So morality, concentration, and wisdom again.

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Miraculous feats focus on concentration.

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Number one is resolve.

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
We need to have strong bodhi resolve.

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I want to be awakened.

82
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I want to be a saint.

83
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So I need to work hard in my meditation and my cultivation.

84
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Then you will put in great effort.

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Be strong and be consistent.

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
We say the dripping water can eventually penetrate a rock.

87
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So consistency, we will succeed.

88
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Number three is mindfulness.

89
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Be mindful all the time, sitting, walking, sleeping, eating.

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
We are always aware of what we are doing and thinking.

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Then we will develop the five faculties.

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
We will develop strong faith in our cultivation,

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
believe in the Amitabha Buddha,

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and know that when we're chanting his name,

95
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
we are one with him,

96
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
and we're glowing in his light.

97
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
We will have strong faith in our Buddha nature.

98
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
We can be just like Buddha if we just cultivate.

99
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
We believe in karma.

100
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Karma is real.

101
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
If I do all that is good,

102
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I will have good karma.

103
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
When you have strong faith and confidence,

104
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
you will put in great effort.

105
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
This effort will be like training for the Olympics,

106
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
except this is more important than winning the gold medal.

107
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
No matter how much setback,

108
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
or how much your leg hurts in the forward position,

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
you will keep going.

110
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Number three is mindfulness.

111
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
We often use the example of hand-hatching eggs.

112
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
If you see those hand-hatching eggs,

113
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
for 21 days they just sit on their eggs without going anywhere.

114
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
They're always mindful of their eggs.

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
That's how we should be when we're meditating.

116
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Always be mindful like we are sitting on the eggs.

117
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Number four is concentration.

118
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
We often use the example of a cat trying to catch a mouse.

119
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
If you've seen the cartoon Tom and Jerry,

120
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
you will know what I mean.

121
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Tom stands very attentively behind the mouse hole,

122
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
waiting for the mouse to come out.

123
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So that's how focused we should be.

124
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Number five, we will have wisdom.

125
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
When you have great concentration,

126
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
then you will know what we mean by non-self.

127
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You will actually experience the state

128
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
of non-self.

129
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The five faculties, we need to balance them.

130
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Balance faith and wisdom.

131
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
When the faith is too strong,

132
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
we use wisdom to think.

133
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And when our effort is too strong,

134
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
we use concentration to calm ourselves down.

135
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So you always want to be in a very balanced state of mindfulness.

136
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
With the five faculties,

137
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
we will develop five powers.

138
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Now we will actually get rid of our defilements.

139
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Faith will overcome our

140
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
doubts.

141
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Effort will overcome our laziness.

142
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Mindfulness will overcome our deluded mind.

143
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Concentration will overcome our scattered mind.

144
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Wisdom will overcome our ignorance.

145
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
This is when we actually transform ourselves

146
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
from a mundane person to a thing that is awakened.

147
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Then we have the seven elements of enlightenment.

148
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
This is meditation.

149
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Number one is mindfulness.

150
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Mindfulness of the present moment

151
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
is actually the greatest virtue.

152
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Number two, discernment.

153
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
We need to discern what is real and what is fake.

154
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The truth is there is no self.

155
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The me I'm using right now is the fake me.

156
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So we need to discern and know the truth.

157
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Number three is effort.

158
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
We need to put in the right effort.

159
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Make sure we don't use defilement.

160
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
For example, don't be angry when you're using effort.

161
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Don't say, oh, I'm horrible at this.

162
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I can't do better.

163
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
When you have anger, that's not good effort.

164
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Or when you have greediness, you're like,

165
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
oh, that person meditated for two hours.

166
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I need to do three hours.

167
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And when you're comparing and greedy,

168
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
that is not good effort either.

169
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So don't use defilement to cultivate.

170
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Number four is joy.

171
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
We want to have this dharma joy

172
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
when we hear of the 37 factor enlightenment.

173
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Doing meditation is like we're seeing Buddha coming alive

174
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
and we have this great joy and rapture.

175
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Number five is tranquility.

176
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Tranquility is a great quality we must develop,

177
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
especially when we have accidents or we're very sick

178
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
or even time of death.

179
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Contemplate on tranquility and relax without any worry or stress.

180
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Number six is concentration.

181
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
We want to be able to concentrate no matter what happens.

182
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Even when going through crisis or a lot of obstacles,

183
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
still concentrate on the name of the Buddha.

184
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
We will make sure that we will be able to chant Buddha's name when we're dying.

185
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Number seven is equanimity.

186
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
This is when we're detached, have this neutral feeling, not happy.

187
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
We're just neutral, calm, still and composed

188
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
when we can reach this balanced state of mind.

189
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
This is actually great meditation.

190
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So everything needs to be balanced.

191
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
If we are too drowsy,

192
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
we use discernment, effort and joy to lift us up.

193
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
When we are restless,

194
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
we use tranquility, concentration and equanimity to calm us down.

195
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So you always want to bring your state of mind to this perfect balance.

196
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Lastly, we have eightfold path.

197
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Again, it's morality, concentration and wisdom.

198
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Number one is right view.

199
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Right view here, we mean the Four Noble Truths.

200
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Suffering, cause of suffering,

201
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
we want to have cessation of suffering.

202
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And how do we practice the path to end suffering?

203
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So everything that you do should correspond with the Four Noble Truths.

204
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Your intention, your thoughts will be based on the Four Noble Truths.

205
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Then your action will follow.

206
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Number three, your speech will follow.

207
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I will make sure I don't curse, gossip, lie

208
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
because they are the causes of suffering.

209
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I don't want to do those things.

210
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
My action will follow.

211
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I do not steal, have sexual misconduct or kill anything

212
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
because those are the causes of suffering that I don't want.

213
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And I will have the right livelihood.

214
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I will not do anything illegal

215
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
because those livelihoods will not bring me to cessation of suffering.

216
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And I will make sure I have the right effort,

217
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
the Four Right Efforts.

218
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And I will have right mindfulness,

219
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
practice the Four Mindfulness.

220
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And I will have right concentration,

221
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
practice the Four Miraculous Feats.

222
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
So I know these things,

223
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
they are the path to end suffering.

224
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So everything you do will follow

225
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
based on the Four Noble Truths.

226
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
So that's the 37 Factors of Enlightenment.

227
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Our original teacher Shakyamuni Buddha

228
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
during his dying day, his last words were

229
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
make my teaching your life, rely upon it,

230
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
do not depend upon it.

231
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Do not depend on anything else.

232
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Make of yourself a light.

233
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Okay, so make this 37 Factors of Enlightenment your light.

234
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
This is what we rely on.

235
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Just depend on this and you will succeed.

236
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Make yourself a light.

237
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You will become enlightened.

238
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Every time I hear this phrase,

239
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I feel very secure, safe and solid in my practice.

240
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Feel like Buddha is with me.

241
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
So thank you my dearest teacher,

242
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Shakyamuni Buddha.

243
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
So that's the class for today.

244
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Thank you for listening.

245
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Amitabha.
