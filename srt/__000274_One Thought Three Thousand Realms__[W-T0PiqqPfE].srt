00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,840
Today we are going to talk about one thought three thousand rounds, which means one instant

2
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,600
of thought has three thousand rounds imminent within it.

3
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:32,060
In this class we will talk about how our mind is the three thousand rounds.

4
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:37,840
First let's look at the ten dharma rounds, there are ten places that we can be in.

5
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,280
From the bottom there is hell, which is full of suffering and torment.

6
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,360
Number two, hungry ghosts, they are cursed with insatiable hunger.

7
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:56,480
Number three, the animal round, they are full of ignorance, just eat and sleep all day long

8
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,680
and they are content with it.

9
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,140
These are the three lower rounds.

10
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:08,380
Then we have number four, asura round, they do good deeds but they are jealous and belligerent

11
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,380
in nature.

12
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:15,740
Number five, humans, we are the only round that can be enlightened but we are burdened

13
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,000
with desires and doubts.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,820
Number six is heavenly beings, they are always wealthy, happy and have very long lives.

15
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:32,340
These are the three higher rounds, these consist of the six rounds of reincarnation.

16
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:38,440
But if we cultivate, we can go up to the four rounds of the sages.

17
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:45,880
Number seven is shravaka and number eight, pratyata buddha, these two, they are self-enlightened

18
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,880
beings.

19
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:53,260
They have strong renunciation to get out of the reincarnation so they let go of all afflictions,

20
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,260
so they are self-enlightened.

21
00:01:54,260 --> 00:02:00,980
Then we have number nine, bodhisattva, not only do they want self-enlightenment, they

22
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:06,760
want to enlighten others, so they are full of compassion and want to deliver all other

23
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,080
sentient beings.

24
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,560
Lastly, we have buddha, who has perfect supreme enlightenment.

25
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:21,780
These are the ten places that we can be in, they are mutually eminent and mutually inclusive.

26
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,120
One round consists of the other rounds.

27
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:30,800
For example, if I am an animal, I can be full of love for others and always let others eat

28
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,220
first, then I am a bodhisattva in the animal round.

29
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,960
So these are all inclusive.

30
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,900
Each ten rounds has ten features related to them.

31
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:47,060
We call it ten features of thusness or suchness.

32
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:52,000
We will use hell and buddha as contrasting examples.

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Number one, exorcism.

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Number two, the third round.

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,080
Every round has their own forms, their outer appearances.

36
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,340
Hell beings, their forms are full of suffering and torment.

37
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:11,620
They are always in punishment, in presence of boiling water, ice, fire, and their body

38
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:16,080
can be torn into pieces, so they are always in pain and suffering.

39
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,400
In contrast, buddha, their form is a conditioned cause of buddha nature.

40
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,880
They are full of goodness and merit.

41
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,880
Number three.

42
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,200
Deer, they carry their own virgins and their own spirits.

43
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,720
Number two is their inner essence.

44
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,980
Everybody has their personality.

45
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,000
The hell beings, their essence is full of anger.

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,140
They are always upset, complaining, full of bitterness.

47
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:42,360
In contrast, buddha, their essence is called the enlightened cause of buddha nature.

48
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,920
It's their perfect wisdom.

49
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,720
So wisdom is buddha's essence.

50
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,880
Number three, substance.

51
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,880
Substance is basically a combination of form and essence.

52
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,880
Or you can call it, wisdom or wisdom.

53
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,880
So wisdom is buddha's essence.

54
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,880
Number three.

55
00:03:53,880 --> 00:04:01,480
we call body and mind the helping their substance is deteriorating body and mind because they're

56
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:09,000
always in degradation on the other hand buddha's substance is their direct cause of buddha nature

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,360
the body of buddha is their suchness we call it the buddha body so they have totally different

58
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:24,440
form essence and substance then we have number four forces every round have their own energy

59
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:30,920
for example how beings they have the energy of repetitive suffering they go through a punishment

60
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:38,280
they die a small breeze blows by they wake up and start experiencing the punishment again they never

61
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:46,280
die so that's their life force buddha's life force is their bodhisattva vow they want to save

62
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:46,360
their life force buddha's life force is their bodhisattva vow they want to save

63
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:52,440
all sentient beings that's their energy just like the earth treasure bodhisattva

64
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:59,720
his vow is i want to save all sentient beings out of hell or i will not become a buddha

65
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:08,280
he wants to save the most painful sentient beings so bodhisattva's vow is their energy number five

66
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:16,280
is action every round has its action or functions hell beings their action is a wholesome

67
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:22,040
action that's why they're in the lower realm buddha set precepts for us the precepts are not

68
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:30,680
for him it's to protect us so we don't go to the unfavorable rounds buddha's actions is their six

69
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:38,520
parameters they like to be giving and hold precepts and be patient especially bodhisattvas

70
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:46,200
are always giving there is a lady in taiwan she sells vegetables for a living and she accumulates

71
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:53,720
a lot of money and donated millions of dollars to the needy just by selling vegetables so bodhisattvas

72
00:05:53,720 --> 00:06:01,080
loves to give that's their action number six main causes for the hell beings their main causes

73
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:09,960
is their unwholesome deeds such as killing stealing and sexual misconduct buddha's causes

74
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:16,120
are the adornment of their perfect wisdom of the middle way which is their buddha nature

75
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:24,360
understanding everything that is conditioned existence is empty in essence number seven is

76
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:32,360
their supporting conditions if the hell things their conditions are their unwholesome craving

77
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:39,080
and clinging their delusions are their supporting conditions and the causes are their actual

78
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:45,720
karmic deeds the conditions the delusions are what's supporting the causes for buddhas

79
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:53,320
conditions are the adornment of their virtues and merits they have the ability to save all sentient

80
00:06:53,320 --> 00:07:01,000
beings because of their merits number eight is effect effect is the habitual effect for

81
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,720
the hell beings they habitually have a lot of anger and resentment so that's the carryover

82
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:16,040
effect habitual effect from prior lifetimes for buddhas their effect is called anathara samyak

83
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:23,480
sambodhi that means supreme perfect enlightenment that's buddha's effect which is becoming

84
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:30,520
perfectly enlightened for retribution is where you really end up in which realm for the hell

85
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:37,800
beings their retribution is being in hell experiencing the punishment buddha's retribution

86
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:45,640
is called the mahaparin nirvana which means mahayana nirvana is another shravaka one-sided

87
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:54,040
nirvana that's a nirvana when you really attain buddhahood number 10 the ultimate state from

88
00:07:54,040 --> 00:08:01,080
number one form essence all the way to number nine all these are conditioned existence and

89
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:09,160
their essence is emptiness that's the ultimate state the true state of all phenomena and that

90
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:15,960
is our buddha nature in essence that's why we call the ultimate state so this is telling us

91
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:24,360
no matter hell or buddha it's all in this one instant of thought which is your absolute mind

92
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:31,320
this is called the single vehicle so it's not three separate vehicles these are just expedient

93
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:38,680
ways that's the only thing buddha wanted to get across his only perspective is to let us know

94
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:45,720
that we all have the buddha nature just like him this is the entire universe and the entire universe

95
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:53,480
is in our one thought lastly we have the three worlds number one the world of living beings

96
00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:00,840
every round has the people that they live with the hell beings they live with people in suffering

97
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:07,880
together and buddha they live with bhakti safa they are just full of compassion number two is

98
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:16,040
the world that beings live in that's the physical place for example the hell is full of steel and

99
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:22,680
middle. For Buddha, they live in the place of eternal, quenching light. That's the place of

100
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:29,620
formlessness. It only has the Buddha nature. Number three is the world of five skantas.

101
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:36,660
The hell beings, they have unwholesome five skantas. For Buddha, their skanta is emptiness,

102
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:44,920
but it's perfect in its emptiness. So the 3,000th round consists of 10 dharma rounds,

103
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:51,720
and in every dharma round, they include the other dharma round. So it's 10 times 10,

104
00:09:52,160 --> 00:10:02,120
times the 10 features, times the three worlds. That's how we get to 3,000 rounds, or 3,000

105
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:10,400
worlds. These 3,000 worlds is all within our one thought, because our mind is the absolute

106
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,900
Buddha mind. This is the only thing that Buddha wanted to

107
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:21,420
let us know, that we are the Buddha to begin with. We're originally imminent with the

108
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:29,920
3,000 worlds. So that's the Tiantai Buddhism conveyed in the Lotus Sutra. So how do we

109
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:36,480
live this life right now? We just have to align ourselves with our absolute mind. If

110
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:43,380
we have a thought of anger, complaint, then we are in hell. If we have the thought of

111
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:52,140
loving kindness and compassion, then we are a Buddha. So it's all up to us. If we really

112
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:59,800
want to end the virus right now, all we have to do is align ourselves with our Buddha thoughts,

113
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:06,560
replace hatred and unwholesome thoughts with loving kindness and compassion. That's the

114
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:13,120
only way to solve any problem. So change the world one thought at a time. Lastly, I want

115
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,220
to share with you one of my favorite Dharma thoughts. The 3,000th round consists of 10

116
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:20,780
one of my favorite stories in buddha's time there was a very very poor lady she sustains her living

117
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:27,980
by begging for food and spare change one very cold night she was begging for food finally she

118
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:34,460
got one small coin at this moment she heard the townspeople say that they're giving light offering

119
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:41,900
to buddha she thought how much i wish i can make a light offering to buddha so she decided to use

120
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:48,780
this one small coin to buy the smallest amount of lamb oil to make light offering to buddha

121
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:55,180
when night time comes the whole city was illuminated with light offering to buddha amidst

122
00:11:55,180 --> 00:12:03,340
the crowd is this poor lady she sincerely lit up her candle at that moment she felt this incredible

123
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:11,500
sense of richness and happiness she made a very sincere and compassionate vow made this light

124
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:19,180
guide all sentient beings out of the suffering of life and death and lead them to the path

125
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:26,460
of ultimate peace and happiness when morning came everybody's life were extinguished

126
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:32,700
except hers buddha's disciples they were all in art and buddha said to them this

127
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:41,020
life was led by a strong and sincere vow that's why it can never be extinguished

128
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:41,900
the poor lady

129
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:50,140
came into the temple and bowed to buddha buddha said to her in 20 kalpas you will become a buddha

130
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:56,780
and you will save immeasurable number of sentient beings your name will be called the lamb light

131
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:04,380
buddha so even though she was in hell she was very very poor but her mind was a buddha she had

132
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:11,740
a sincere bodhi resolve to save all sentient beings so at that moment she is a buddha and

133
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:19,100
she will become a buddha no matter how much suffering we are in don't be hopeless we are all

134
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:25,900
buddha at every moment in time if we just come back and align ourselves with our true nature

135
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:31,500
so that's the class for today thank you for listening amitabha
