1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Today we are going to talk about Upholding Precepts.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Precepts are the foundation of Bodhi, which is enlightenment.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Only if we sincerely withhold precepts can we transform ourselves into Buddhas.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
In the Shakyamuni Sutra, it says collecting one's thoughts consists of precepts.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
From precepts comes samadhi. From samadhi comes wisdom.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So precepts, samadhi, and wisdom, these three are inseparable and go hand in hand with each other.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
These are called the three non-flow of study.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We must have precepts first.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
In this class, we will learn about ten major Bodhisattva precepts.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
From the Brahmanic Sutra.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Number one, precept on killing.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We cannot intentionally kill any living creature that includes humans, animals, and insects.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Because a Bodhisattva always nurtures a mind of great compassion and kindness.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Killing is the very antithesis of compassion.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So we cannot kill or harm any like creatures.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Precepts are Buddha's way of protecting and safeguarding us.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
No killing is to protect us from short life span and sickness.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Number two, precept on stealing.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Do not take possession of anything that doesn't belong to you.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That includes cheating on taxes, gambling, or getting government benefits that you're not supposed to have.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You will lose it in other ways.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Such as fire, flood, government.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Thieves or squandering children.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
They will take away what you're not supposed to have.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
There was a government official that was very noble.

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So he resists on taking any bribery.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
After he retired, he lived in the third unit of a four unit town home.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
One day there was a fire that burned down unit one, two, and four.

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Miraculously, his unit was not damaged by the fire.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Why is this?

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Because his holding precepts.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Of not taking any briberies.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So holding precepts will always give you positive karma.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Number three, precept on sexual misconduct.

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Adultery ruins families.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Do not put yourself in a situation that you might be tempted.

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Or you're tempting others.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
We want to be proper and righteous.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Then no one will come entice you.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So it's all up to you to have the conviction.

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
To be loyal.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
To be loyal to your spouse.

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And for nuns and moms, they're forbidden to have any sexual activities.

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Because it's the rule of life and death.

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Number four is precept on lying and false speech.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
This one is the most common to break.

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Because we lie a lot.

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's either because we want to boast about ourselves.

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Or we want to get some benefit for ourselves.

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Or we want to cover up some mistakes.

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
All these are bad intentions.

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Honesty is the best solution to everything.

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Number five is precept on selling alcohol.

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
For the five precepts, the precept is no drinking of alcohol.

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But for bodhisattvas, drinking alcohol is actually a minor offense.

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But selling alcohol is major offense.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Because for bodhisattva,

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The most important is do not harm others.

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
When you sell alcohol, you're harming others.

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
When you drink alcohol, you're just hurting yourself.

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So that becomes a minor offense.

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So we do not want to sell any alcohol.

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Or give anybody wine or beer as presents.

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
To cloud their mind.

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And prevent their innate wisdom.

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So we do not want to have any substance that will confuse us.

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And make us deluded.

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Number six is precept on broadcasting the faults of the assembly.

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Bodhisattvas cannot gossip.

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
If we keep saying the wrongdoing of monks and temples,

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
How is Buddhism going to flourish?

72
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
We can privately counsel others of their wrongdoing.

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But do not disclose it in public.

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
When we publicly disclose the faults of others,

75
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's because number one,

76
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
We are jealous of other people's accomplishments.

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Or number two,

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's out of anger.

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
We want to punish them.

80
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Both of these are ill intentions.

81
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And their afflictions.

82
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Bodhisattva always watch their thoughts and their intentions.

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And do not break any precepts with their thoughts.

84
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Number seven is precept on praising oneself and disparaging others.

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So there's two parts to this precept.

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
One is praising.

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
One is praising oneself.

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And the second part is disparaging others.

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
When you do both of these,

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It becomes a major offense.

91
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Praising oneself is because of our arrogance.

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
When we disparage others,

93
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's because we have jealousy.

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Or we are greedy for other people's respect and offerings.

95
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
A Bodhisattva actually does the opposite.

96
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
They actually disclose their own shortcomings.

97
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And praise others of their good qualities.

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
That way they will give the glory to others.

99
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And take the blame themselves.

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
That is a true Bodhisattva.

101
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Number eight,

102
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Precept on stinginess and abuse.

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
A Bodhisattva always gives.

104
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
They are willing to give everything.

105
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So if we are stingy with money or Dharma,

106
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
That is all stinginess.

107
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Sometimes we might lie and say,

108
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Oh, I don't have any money.

109
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Or I don't know this Dharma.

110
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
When you do that,

111
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You've been stingy.

112
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And if you even scold them

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Because you discriminate against them

114
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And think they don't deserve any money or Dharma,

115
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
That is even worse.

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That's called abuse.

117
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So when you do that,

118
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It breaks a major precept.

119
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Bodhisattva,

120
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
They are afraid of causes.

121
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Mountain people are afraid of retributions.

122
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Bodhisattva,

123
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
They always watch their thoughts.

124
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
They don't want to have the cause of suffering.

125
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Because they want to leave suffering and leave samsara.

126
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Number nine is

127
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Precept on anger and resentment.

128
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So number eight is greediness.

129
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Number nine is anger.

130
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Number ten is ignorance.

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Bodhisattva means someone with great compassion.

132
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And anger is the opposite of compassion.

133
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
This precept actually has two parts.

134
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
One is being angry.

135
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Two is holding grudges.

136
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Bodhisattva cannot do either of those.

137
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
When other people apologize to us for their fault,

138
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
We have to accept their apology and forgive them.

139
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
We cannot hold any grudges against anyone.

140
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
That is the precept.

141
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So refrain from being angry.

142
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Number ten is a precept on slandering the triple jewels.

143
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
This is ignorance.

144
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
We slander the triple jewels.

145
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You say, how can we slander the triple jewels?

146
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
We are Buddhists.

147
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
A lot of times we do it without knowing it.

148
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
For example, we might say,

149
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Oh, just chant Amitabha.

150
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
We don't need to read any sutras.

151
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
That is actually slandering the triple jewels.

152
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Because you are not respecting Shakyamuni Buddha's Dharma.

153
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
That's not what he meant when he introduced Pure Land Buddhism.

154
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
He wants us to hold precepts and study all the Dharma.

155
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And to know how to be enlightened.

156
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Purifying the mind is the meaning of Buddhism.

157
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So we need to purify our mind to go to the Pure Land.

158
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Because a pure mind creates the Pure Land.

159
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So we make sure we know the correct Dharma.

160
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Do not disclose the wrong Dharma to anybody.

161
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Some people say the Shogama Sutra or Mahayana Sutra are not expounded by Buddha.

162
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
That's also slandering the Dharma.

163
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So we gotta be very cautious with what we say.

164
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
To prevent us from being ignorant and breaking this precept.

165
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
All these precepts are to deal with a Bodhisattva's own afflictions.

166
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Our reason of cultivating is to break our vexations and defilements.

167
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
We must hold precepts to help us conquer our defilements.

168
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:20,000
In conclusion, sentient beings on receiving the Buddha's precepts join forth with the rank of Buddha.

169
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
They are in essence equal to the Buddha's.

170
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
They are the true offspring of the Buddha's.

171
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So this is actually in the Brahman's Sutra.

172
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It says when we receive the Bodhisattva precepts, immediately we join the rank of all Buddha.

173
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
We are in essence the same as all Buddha.

174
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And we are the sons of Buddha.

175
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
So there's immense benefit by holding precepts.

176
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Especially the Bodhisattva precepts.

177
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Don't be afraid of holding precepts.

178
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
They are not restraints for you.

179
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
They are actually helping you to walk the path of Buddhahood.

180
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Every Buddha holds these precepts in order to reach Buddhahood.

181
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So we must follow the same path.

182
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Hold the precepts as brilliant gems.

183
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
They are precious and valuable.

184
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
We should be grateful that we can encounter the Dharma and hold the Bodhisattva precepts.

185
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So don't be afraid.

186
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
If you're afraid, it's like someone who wants to become a doctor but doesn't want to go to medical school.

187
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
How are you going to become a doctor?

188
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So gladly hold the precepts.

189
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's a beginning to yourself reaching Buddhahood.

190
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So that's the class for today.

191
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Thank you for listening. Amitabha.

192
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
