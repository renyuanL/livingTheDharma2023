1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,560
Today we are going to talk about virtues and relationships.

2
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,480
We are all searching for happiness.

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,480
According to the ancient things, the key to happiness is to cultivate virtues and build

4
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,000
harmonious relationships.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,840
So today we are going to talk about five social relationships, five ethics standards and

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,840
eight virtues.

7
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,380
Let's start with the five social relationships.

8
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,100
Number one, parent and child.

9
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,920
The parents should be loving and the children should be respectful.

10
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,600
Parents give us lives and raise us up.

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,240
This kind of unconditional love and kindness is priceless.

12
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,560
So this is the most valuable relationship.

13
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,420
In the olden days, there was a Mr. Yang.

14
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,820
He was a devoted Buddhist.

15
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:10,200
One day he decided to leave home and go look for this Zen master far away.

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,760
So he walked for days and on the way he met a monk.

17
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,700
The monk asked, where are you going?

18
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,400
He said, I'm trying to find this well-known Zen master.

19
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,440
He said, oh, why don't you go find Buddha instead?

20
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,480
He said, where do I find Buddha?

21
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,480
He says, oh, easy.

22
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,400
You just turn back toward your home.

23
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,400
If you see Buddha, you go find Buddha.

24
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,400
He said, where do I find Buddha?

25
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,100
You see someone wearing a yellow robe and having their slippers on the wrong feet.

26
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,960
That person is Buddha.

27
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:41,820
So this person walked back and for days he didn't find anyone that meets the description.

28
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,440
Finally he reached home.

29
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,500
He knocked on the door and his mother came out.

30
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,960
And much to the surprise, his mother was wearing a yellow robe and having her slippers on the

31
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,260
wrong feet.

32
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,260
So who is Buddha?

33
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,460
Buddha is your mother.

34
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,020
So if you're a Buddhist.

35
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,600
You should be filial and loving to your parents.

36
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,460
If you can't even love and respect your parents, then no matter how many omitofu you chant,

37
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:12,340
it's not going to work because you don't have the heart of the Buddha.

38
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,520
Number two is siblings.

39
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,220
The younger siblings should respect the older siblings and the older siblings should be

40
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,540
gentle and caring to the younger siblings.

41
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,720
The siblings are like branches on the same tree.

42
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,220
If we fight with each other.

43
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:31,100
It's like rotting the root and killing the tree slowly.

44
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,900
We should be loving to our siblings.

45
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:39,200
A hundred years ago, there was a 15 year old girl named Hazel Miner.

46
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:47,820
On March 15, 1920, she drove her younger brother and sister to school as usual in a carriage.

47
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:54,120
By noontime, because of the huge blizzard, their carriage tipped over and they were stranded.

48
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,500
Hazel was soaking wet, but she didn't care for herself.

49
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,000
That's it.

50
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,260
She found two blankets and a robe.

51
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:05,980
She wrapped them around her brothers and sisters and she also opened her own coat and spread

52
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,840
it around her brother and sister, trying to keep them warm.

53
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,540
She also kept telling them stories and sing songs and prayers, hoping to make them stay

54
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,540
awake.

55
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:21,000
25 hours later, the villagers finally found them.

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,500
By this time, Hazel, she froze to death and saved her brother and sister.

57
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:33,500
Hazel's monument is still in the Oliver County Courthouse in North Dakota.

58
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,180
Hazel can sacrifice her life for her siblings.

59
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,620
How can we fight with our siblings for little things?

60
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,420
Number three is husband and wife.

61
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,820
This is the most important relationship.

62
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:51,820
If this one is harmonious, then all other relationships will be harmonious as well.

63
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,820
There were two couples.

64
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,820
They live across the street from each other.

65
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,820
Couple A and B are in a relationship.

66
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,820
They live on the same street.

67
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,740
Couple A fights every other day.

68
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,440
Couple B never fought.

69
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:06,360
So finally one day, the couple A's wife went to couple B's wife and asked, what is your

70
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,360
secret?

71
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,740
How come we're always fighting and you guys never fight?

72
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:16,980
Couple B's wife said, oh, it's easy because everybody in your family is good people.

73
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,560
Everybody in my family is bad people.

74
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,820
The couple A's wife said, oh, that doesn't make any sense.

75
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,820
Couple B's wife said, whenever something happens, you have to be careful.

76
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,820
You have to be careful.

77
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,820
You have to be careful.

78
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,820
Every single one of us can be thick.

79
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,820
You have to be careful.

80
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,400
There is a single thing that goes wrong in your family because everybody insists on being

81
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,740
right and good people so nobody admits their fault so you guys will be arguing and fighting.

82
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:42,800
But in my family, when something goes wrong, we will admit our fault and apologize and

83
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,060
change our ways.

84
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,980
That's why in my family, we never fight.

85
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:53,780
So in order to have a good marriage relationship, we should be apologetic and we should always

86
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,340
be respectful for our spouse.

87
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:55,780
Thank you.

88
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:11,240
Number four is rulers and subjects. This applies to employers and employees. According to Mencius, if the ruler treats the subject like brothers, then the subject would treat the ruler like a best friend.

89
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:32,400
If the ruler treats the subject like dogs and horses, then the subject would treat the ruler like a stranger. If the ruler treats the subject like machines, then the subject would treat the ruler like an enemy. So how you treat others is how others will treat you. The relationship is reciprocal.

90
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,560
Number five is between friends. Friends have five duties to each other.

91
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,220
Number one, we have to give sound.

92
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,460
Virtuous advice so our friend doesn't go down the wrong path.

93
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:52,180
Number two, we should be caring. When they're going through a difficult time, we should be there to comfort them.

94
00:05:52,180 --> 00:06:00,980
Number three, we should praise them when they are doing good deeds. We should praise them and encourage them to succeed in their endeavors.

95
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:08,980
Number four, we should keep secrets. When they tell us their family secrets, we cannot disclose it to anyone else.

96
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,980
Number five, we should give fine-grain-water.

97
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,080
Number five, we should give fine-grain-water.

98
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,180
Number five, we should give fine-grain-water.

99
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:11,200
Number five, we should give fine-grain-water.

100
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:16,600
financial support. When they're in a sudden financial crisis, we need to help them in

101
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:23,380
any way we can. So these are the five social relationships that we all have. In order for

102
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:30,380
these five social relationships to be harmonious, we need to have the five ethics standards.

103
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:38,440
Number one is loving kindness. Loving kindness is the root to all virtues. In Chinese, it's

104
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:44,500
the symbol of wisdom. On the left side, it's human. On the right side, it means the number

105
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:50,800
two. So two people stack up together. That means the relationship is very thick. We're

106
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:58,580
always thinking for the other person and we're not being selfish. Number two is duties. We

107
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:04,720
must follow our duties and play our role. If you're a father, be a good father. If

108
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,420
you're a son, be a good son. If you're a wife, be a good wife.

109
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:14,900
When you perform your duties, then the relationship will be in harmony. That way, you can be a

110
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:21,300
role model to all people and other people will follow your footsteps. Number three is

111
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:30,680
respect. Respect is the beauty in all relationships. If you want the relationship to be beautiful,

112
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:36,760
you need to keep a distance and show respect. Don't be careless because you're too close

113
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,420
and you say things that are rude.

114
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:46,600
So always have respect, especially between husband and wife. Number four is wisdom. In

115
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:53,740
order to have wisdom, we must first learn education on virtues. In school, we only learn

116
00:07:53,740 --> 00:08:00,460
about knowledge on how to obtain a career, but we don't learn about morals and ethics.

117
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:06,180
So now we need to learn about virtues and apply the virtues to all different kinds of

118
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,200
relationships. That is wisdom.

119
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:15,820
Number five is trustworthiness. We have to be the person that everybody can count on.

120
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:22,240
They can trust you whenever they're in need to help them. So these five ethics standards,

121
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:29,280
if you expand them, they become eight virtues. Number one, filial piety. This is specific

122
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:37,800
to parent and child. This word is also a symbol of wisdom. On the top, it means old. On the

123
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:45,020
bottom, it means son. So the older generation on top of the younger generation together

124
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:51,580
as one. So we should not have any generation gap. If we have love and respect in our heart,

125
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,820
there is no problem and no conflict in the family.

126
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:02,460
Number two, we have to be respectful to elderlies. This is between siblings. We need to respect

127
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:07,300
our older siblings and respect them like they're our parents.

128
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:14,260
You can show respect in many ways. For example, when you're eating, drinking, walking, sitting,

129
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:18,740
you always let the elderlies go first to show your respect.

130
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:25,800
Number three, we need to have loyalty. Loyalty is between ruler and subject, but it also

131
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:32,900
apply to many different relationship. For example, you and Buddha. You need to be loyal

132
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,700
to Buddha. That means always follow his teaching.

133
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:41,420
Don't be an eye servant. Only good when someone's watching you.

134
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:47,560
Number four is trustworthiness. That applies to friends. You want to be the trustworthy

135
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:54,020
person that everybody can count on. You cannot make any empty promises. If you said it, you

136
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:59,060
have to do it. You have to be a credible person and be trustworthy.

137
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:06,180
Number five, we have to show respect. The best way is to treat each other like VIPs,

138
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:12,440
especially husband and wife. If you treat each other with respect, then nothing will

139
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:19,980
go wrong. This is well tested in 5,000 years of history. So show each other respect in

140
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,820
all relationships.

141
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:29,200
Number six is duties. We need to perform our duties in all five relationships, especially

142
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:36,220
the first one, parent and child. We have the responsibility to take care of our parents

143
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:42,100
when they're old and sick. We cannot just send them to senior homes because it is our

144
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,460
duty to take care of them.

145
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:51,100
Number seven is to have honor. This applies to rulers and subjects. Especially with the

146
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:58,100
subject, you cannot take any briberies. You have to be loyal and honest. In the Han Dynasty,

147
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:04,020
there was a Mr. Yang. He was being promoted to a very high government official position.

148
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,700
So on the way to see the emperor, he passed by the emperor. He passed by the emperor.

149
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,700
He passed by the emperor. He passed by the emperor. He passed by the emperor. He passed

150
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:12,680
by the city. The magistrate of the city, Mr. Wang, tried to bribe Mr. Yang. So in the

151
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:19,320
middle of the night, he took out 10 kilograms of gold and tried to give to Mr. Yang. And

152
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:25,020
when he offered it to Mr. Yang, Mr. Yang said, I cannot take this. Mr. Wang said, oh, it's

153
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:30,920
middle of the night. It's so dark. Nobody will know. Just take it. And Mr. Yang said,

154
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:36,600
God knows. Earth knows. You know. I know. How can you say nobody knows?

155
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,520
So we need to be a man of honor and never take briberies.

156
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:46,780
Number eight is shame. We need to feel ashamed when we are not behaving according to our

157
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:52,440
virtues. We all have the virtues inside of us. Sometimes we cannot do it. We should feel

158
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:58,860
ashamed. Man-shin says shame is the greatest and the most important word in a person's

159
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:04,960
lifetime. Because when we feel remorse and ashamed, we will put in our best effort to

160
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,580
change our ways and correct our mistakes.

161
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:12,960
We should be able to overcome our faults and reach sageshood. So these are the five social

162
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:18,220
relationships, five ethics standards, and eight virtues. If you follow this, you will

163
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:24,880
have a harmonious relationship and you will be truly happy. We all say we want to reach

164
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,480
Buddhahood. But in order to be a Buddha, first we need to be a virtuous person. If we're

165
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,920
not virtuous and we learn all the Buddhism and all the philosophy, it's not going to

166
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,560
because it's meaningless when you don't apply it.

167
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,220
Use Buddhism and Confucianism in your own life

168
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,860
and solve all your relationship problems.

169
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,660
And that way, you will gain true happiness.

170
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,520
So that's the class for today.

171
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,700
Thank you for listening.

172
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,460
Om Nito Fo.
