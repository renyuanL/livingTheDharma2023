00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,600
Today we are going to talk about separation from illusion.

2
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,020
Buddha says to separate from illusion is to be enlightened.

3
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:28,320
We will use the Perfect Enlightenment Sutra together with the Shogama Sutra to understand

4
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,320
enlightenment.

5
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,560
In the Perfect Enlightenment Sutra, Buddha taught Samantabhadra Bodhisattva there are

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,160
actually four steps to the separation from illusion.

7
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,160
1.

8
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:44,080
To separate oneself from all illusory projections and deluded realms.

9
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:50,740
This world that we live in is merely a projection of images from our own alaya consciousness,

10
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:55,040
therefore all is created by our mind is merely an illusion.

11
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,280
This sutra uses the metaphor of a man with the illness of the eye.

12
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:09,120
The sickness of the eye symbolizes our ignorance, and the illusory flower means our attachment

13
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:16,120
to the four great elements as attributes of our bodies, and the condition of the sixth

14
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,160
sense objects as attributes of our mind.

15
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:25,120
We think this physical body is me, and the mind that grabs onto the sixth sense objects

16
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,120
as me.

17
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,120
This is all just our illusion.

18
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,120
This is all just our illusion.

19
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,120
This is all just our illusion.

20
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:36,740
There is in reality no flower in the sky yet the sick man mistakenly clings to it.

21
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:42,660
Because of his mistaken clinging, he is not only deluded about the intrinsic nature of

22
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:47,880
the empty sky, he is also confused about the rising of the flower.

23
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,680
Because of his false existence to which he clings, he remains in the turning wheel of

24
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,680
birth and death.

25
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,960
So there is actually no flower in the sky.

26
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:04,880
empty sky symbolizes our perfect nature. It's without any ignorance. Our ignorance is what

27
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,080
makes us keep reincarnating, so we need to let go of the idea of the self.

28
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:17,040
There is a devoted Buddhist practitioner whose farmland is being occupied by a bully in the

29
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,280
village without permission for many years. One time, the land officer came to mark all

30
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,000
the lands in the village. The bully was very upset and said to the officer who dared to

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,780
come over here to mark the land, I will beat him to the ground. Then everyone started arguing

32
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:39,920
and he said you can sue me in court if you want. The Buddhist lady came in and said,

33
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,960
when we are all together, we should be happy. Please don't be angry. Then she said to the

34
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:50,240
man, do you want to give the land back to us? He said, of course not. Then she said,

35
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,240
oh that's no problem. You are like my parents. I'm not going to give it back to you.

36
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:59,400
i should be filial to you this land officer just wants to mark the land so everybody know our

37
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:05,800
boundaries tomorrow you can still form this land if you're happy then i'm happy she was about to

38
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:12,680
leave that's when the man actually called her name from behind he said in tears i want to give the

39
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:18,920
land back to you everyone in the village was so surprised by this dramatic change when you're

40
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:25,640
selfless and sincere things will always work out for the best so be selfless and kind and

41
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:33,160
know the illusion of the self number two however when one clings firmly to the mind that separates

42
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:39,080
this mind should also be taken as illusion and one should separate oneself from it we do not

43
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,880
want to cling to the mind that's doing the separation from illusion because when you

44
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,840
attach to it it's also an illusion for example when we meditate we

45
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:55,880
usually call it mindfulness meditation why because we have awareness that is mindful

46
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:03,480
of an object of meditation such as the name amitabha or emptiness in this case we're focusing

47
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:10,600
on contemplating on the illusory nature of our body and mind but this mind that is aware

48
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:18,360
also needs to let go if i catch myself having a negative thought about a person at work i tell

49
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:18,840
myself

50
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:24,280
i should let go of the thoughts i should let go of the thoughts but the more you say that to yourself

51
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:31,560
the more you think about it so let go of this awareness and naturally you will be able to let

52
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:38,280
go of wandering thoughts and you will be able to feel at ease so do not be attached to this

53
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:44,840
awareness either number three because the separation is illusion it should be separated

54
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,360
the separation we used above should be separated as well

55
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,800
because it is only a dharma tool we should not be attached to this dharma tool

56
00:04:53,800 --> 00:05:00,280
it is also illusory so there's no siddhama for anyone do not be attached to your practice

57
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:06,920
either for example i have to chant ten thousand amitabha a day or i have to meditate for five

58
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:13,240
hours in order to be a good practitioner if you're attached to your dharma it is also ignorance

59
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,120
in the diamond sutra buddha says if someone says that the buddha has the false

60
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,880
dharma he is really slandering the dharma

61
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:27,000
because if someone has a certain dharma he is calumniating the buddha

62
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,920
for the person could not comprehend what i have divulged

63
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,880
so if someone says buddha has a certain dharma he is slandering the buddha

64
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,760
because he does not know what the dharma means so let go of our attachment to the

65
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:46,440
dharma as well it is illusory dharma number four one should then be free from

66
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,240
even the separating from the illusion of separation all the separation of delusion is also delusory

67
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:55,860
above should be separated. So let go of separating or separation of illusion. Every last bit

68
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:02,120
of attachment should be let go. In conclusion, when there remains nothing to be separated

69
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:08,880
from, all illusions are eliminated. When all illusions extinguish, that's when the perfect

70
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:15,520
enlightenment remains unmoved. Then that's the real complete enlightenment. This sutra

71
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,440
uses another metaphor. It's like rubbing two pieces of wood together to obtain fire.

72
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,680
When the wood completely burns, the ashes fly away and the smoke vanishes. The two pieces

73
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:35,940
of wood is like number one, separation from delusion. And the fire is like separation

74
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:42,560
from awareness. The smoke vanishes is like number three, let go of separation. And ashes

75
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,500
flying away is like let go of letting go of delusion.

76
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:52,380
Letting go of separation. What's left over is just the ground that's perfectly unmoved.

77
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:58,580
This ground symbolizes our Buddha nature that is perfectly enlightened. This is called using

78
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:06,600
illusion to remedy illusion. Use the illusory body and mind to cultivate the illusory dharma.

79
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:12,740
So that's how we reach enlightenment. That's our innate prajna. Now let's combine it with

80
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,060
Triyogama Sutra and the Sutra Guanyin Bodhisattva.

81
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:20,840
Guanyin Bodhisattva said, Initially, I entered the flow through hearing and forgot objective

82
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:26,820
states. Since the sense object and the sense organs were quiet, the characteristics of

83
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:33,160
movement and stillness crystallized and did not arise. So Guanyin Bodhisattva became enlightened

84
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:39,100
through hearing. By hearing, he forgot the objective states. There's no more external

85
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:45,480
environment. Both sound, which is movement, and stillness, which is no sound, they become

86
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:50,420
invisible. They don't bother her anymore. And she was with her suchness, with her enlightened

87
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:57,480
mind. This is the first stage, separation from delusion. After that, gradually advancing,

88
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,660
the hearing and what was heard both disappeared.

89
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:06,860
That's number two, separating from the awareness. Once the hearing was gone, there was nothing

90
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:14,600
to rely on, and awareness and the object awareness became empty. That's number three, let go

91
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,360
of separation.

92
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:23,060
So the awareness and the object awareness were both empty. When the emptiness of awareness

93
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:28,580
reached ultimate perfection, the emptiness and what was being emptied then also ceased

94
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,580
to be.

95
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:36,440
That's number four, let go of letting go of separation. Since the protection and extinction

96
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:42,700
were gone, still extinction was revealed. This still extinction is when there is no

97
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,600
illusion to be eliminated.

98
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:50,700
That's our perfect enlightenment. That's how Guanyin Bodhisattva became enlightened is through

99
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:58,020
this process of separating from illusion. In conclusion, to know illusion is to depart

100
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:06,020
from it. There is no need to contrive expedient means. To depart from illusion is to be enlightened.

101
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:12,740
There is no gradual steps. To know illusion is to depart from it. We just have to know

102
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,740
what is illusion.

103
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:20,360
Everything is illusion. There is no gradual steps or expedient means. We just have to

104
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:26,080
depart from illusion. Then that's perfect complete enlightenment. So all we have to do

105
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,080
is to know.

106
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:32,820
This is a certain teaching of the Mahayana Buddhism. This is where we should put all

107
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:38,580
our attention to because this is the fastest and the quickest way to enlightenment. This

108
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,840
enlightenment is called the complete illumination of intrinsic enlightenment. This is the ultimate

109
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,840
enlightenment of the body. My the knowledge of enlightenment has been enhanced have been

110
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,620
strengthened. This is the only way you can attain enlightenment. What we have to do is to

111
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:49,700
which is pure in essence and the samadhi is called the samadhi in which all is seen to be like

112
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:57,060
illusion this enlightenment is the perfect complete enlightenment all we have to do is to know

113
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:04,820
illusion when you know then it is done it's so easy we don't even know how this is called certain

114
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:11,460
enlightenment where the causal ground and the final enlightenment is all based on the same thing

115
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:17,140
which is a perfectly pure enlightened mind so that's the class for today thank you for listening
