1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,560
Today we are going to talk about Settling the Mind.

2
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:23,480
In the Lotus Sutra, it states that Buddha peacefully dwelling in the Great Vehicle,

3
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:29,720
dignified with the powers of meditative absorption and perfect wisdom, saves all sentient beings

4
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,000
from sufferings.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,680
Buddha has meditated absorption and perfect wisdom.

6
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,600
Both of these come from deep meditation.

7
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,200
Thus we need to learn how to meditate and settle our mind.

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,280
Today we are going to learn 5 meditations to settle our mind and each of the meditation

9
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,000
tailors for a specific affliction.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,800
Number 1 for greed, contemplate on the impurities of the body.

11
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,680
A lot of people are afraid of this meditation but it is actually a great antidote for curing

12
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,520
our sensual desires, our strongest greed.

13
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:10,740
For example, if you see someone that is beautiful and you start having sensual desires, what

14
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:17,860
you can do is say to yourself, since the skin on this body is rotting away, smelly, living

15
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,720
on a filthy body and deteriorating, skin is disgusting to see and touch.

16
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,880
And if you love the hair of this person, you can say to yourself, I love the hair of this

17
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,640
person.

18
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:32,520
If you repeat the same thing, hair on this body is rotting away, smelly, living on a

19
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,800
filthy body, deteriorating, hair is disgusting to see and touch.

20
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,180
If you keep repeating these verses, you will get rid of all your lusts.

21
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,180
Another way is called the white skeleton meditation.

22
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:52,280
Basically you have x-ray eyes and you see everyone beyond their flesh and skin.

23
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,880
You see everybody as white bones walking around, sitting still.

24
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,240
That way you will get rid of all your attachments.

25
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,180
So once you reach the root of goodness in this meditation, you will have enlightenment

26
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,320
about impermanence and you will be detached from all desires and the perception of the

27
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,320
self.

28
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,840
Number two, for anger, contemplate on compassion.

29
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,620
Anger when we are angry, our mind is definitely agitated and not settled.

30
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,520
So we need to use compassion meditation.

31
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,520
There is a reason why we need compassion.

32
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:24,720
There is a reason why we need compassion.

33
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:24,840
There is a reason why we need compassion.

34
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,720
There is a great compassion meditation called the seven point cause and effect meditation.

35
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,560
Before we do this meditation, we need to develop the mind of equanimity, which is feeling peaceful

36
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,400
and calm about all sentient beings.

37
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:45,080
You can think of three people, one, a friend that you love, two, an enemy you dislike,

38
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,120
three, a stranger you don't really know, then you think, one, the person I love right now

39
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,680
in prior lifetime was probably my enemy, so don't be too attached to the person.

40
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:01,520
Number two, the enemy right now that I dislike in prior lifetime was probably my loved one,

41
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,440
so let go of the animosity.

42
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,760
Three, the stranger I do not care about right now, that's not right in prior lifetime was

43
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,120
probably my loved one, so start loving the person.

44
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,400
If you can treat your friend, enemy, and stranger exactly the same, that is called equanimity.

45
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,520
With this mentality, we start the seven point cause and effect meditation.

46
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,520
You think of all sentient beings.

47
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:30,560
Ask your mother who gives you motherly love, but if you don't like your mother, then don't

48
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,640
use your mother.

49
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:38,360
You can use a father or a grandmother or grandfather or even a master that you really admire.

50
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,280
Number two, you will think of the kindness of the mother.

51
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,080
She changed your diaper and fed you and did everything for you.

52
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,360
You really appreciate all the kindness.

53
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,340
Number three, you want to repay her kindness.

54
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,520
You really want to take care of her.

55
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:59,520
And help her in any way you can because you really appreciate all her kindness.

56
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,960
Then you will develop number four, great love, and number five, great compassion.

57
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,040
Great love is you want to give her happiness.

58
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,340
Great compassion, you want to uproot her sufferings.

59
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:17,120
Great love, you really want to appraise her, help her, spend time with her, and even teaching

60
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,640
her Buddhism, let her gain wisdom and true happiness.

61
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,300
And you want to give her great compassion.

62
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,120
You want to uproot all her sufferings as if she's falling off a cliff and you want

63
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,120
to save her.

64
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,960
Number six, you will develop exceptional resolve.

65
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,440
You feel this responsibility, I'm the only one who can save my mother.

66
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,980
You feel this urgency and you're on a great mission to help her.

67
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:48,560
Number seven, you will develop Bodhi mind, that is called the Bodhi Chitta, the true

68
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,420
mind of a Bodhisattva who really wants to become a Buddha to save all sentient beings

69
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:58,840
from suffering because all sentient beings are my mother.

70
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,860
If you can go through the seven point cause and effect meditation, you will no longer

71
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,660
have any anger toward anyone.

72
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:12,280
So once you develop the root of goodness in this meditation, in real life, you'll be able

73
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,640
to treat all people with love and kindness.

74
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,420
Number three, for lack of focus, count the breath.

75
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,760
A lot of us lack focus.

76
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,380
Often we have so much thing going on in our lives.

77
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,400
We cannot sit down and start meditating.

78
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:33,140
What we can do is Anapana meditation, which is focusing on our breath.

79
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:40,780
Inhale, exhale, one, inhale, exhale, two, all the way up to ten.

80
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,620
If you have wandering thoughts in between, just start over from one.

81
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:51,560
And if you don't like counting, you can use a mantra or use Amitabha Buddha's name, inhale

82
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,800
ah, exhale me, inhale two.

83
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,440
Inhale ta, exhale ba.

84
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,200
In Chinese, it will be omi tofo.

85
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:04,540
If you keep repeating this process, you will be able to anchor and focus your mind and

86
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,540
go into deep meditation.

87
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:11,000
When you're really good at it, you no longer need to count and you'll be able to follow

88
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,560
your breathing easily and effortlessly.

89
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,480
Once you reach the root of goodness in this meditation, you will have inconceivable joy,

90
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,920
clarity and tranquility.

91
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,820
Every hairbrush will be filled with joy.

92
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,800
Every hairbrush will be filled with joy.

93
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:29,840
Every pore of your body will relaxingly open and your inner eye will be able to see all

94
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,300
36 things inside of your body like an open fridge.

95
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:39,300
Number four, for ignorance, contemplate on cause and conditions.

96
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,560
Ignorant, we don't mean someone who don't have knowledge.

97
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,980
You can be a PhD and is still considered ignorant, which means someone who has a strong sense

98
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,680
of the self and their ego.

99
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,440
Then we need to focus on cause and conditions.

100
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,440
Cause is the most important thing.

101
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:59,120
Cause is basically the main factor of everything and conditions are the helping factors.

102
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,920
For example, you have an apple seed, that's the cause.

103
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:08,940
You plant it in the soil, you give it sunlight and water and it grows into a tree.

104
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:13,280
So everything in this world is basically cause and conditions.

105
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,020
In this cause and condition, there is not a me, so it's empty of a self.

106
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,560
So Buddha says to contemplate on all things and see the cause and conditions that is empty

107
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,560
of a self.

108
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,540
We should think about our body and mind the same way.

109
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:34,700
So Buddha called the body and mind the five aggregates or the five skantas, which are

110
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:39,820
form, feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness.

111
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,700
You should think all your body and mind as empty.

112
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:48,800
For example, you see your form, this is just a body, it's not my body.

113
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,460
When I'm sick, it's just cause and conditions.

114
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,460
This is not me.

115
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,200
I am the Buddha nature.

116
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,040
I am the treasury of Tathagata.

117
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,880
Number two, my feeling.

118
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,260
This person criticizes me, I'm upset.

119
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:08,440
This feeling is not me, it's just cause and conditions happening.

120
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,840
I'm much bigger than this.

121
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,160
I'm not this feeling.

122
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,080
I am the treasury of Tathagata.

123
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,740
Number three, my perception is not me.

124
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,540
How come in my mother, Yao Ling, and my brother, I don't feel anything, but mother Yao Ling

125
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,700
and me, I'm insulted.

126
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:27,040
I'm insulted and upset, it's because I have a false sense of the self.

127
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:31,160
Let go of this because it's just cause and conditions happening.

128
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,740
Let go of my perception.

129
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,700
I am the treasury of Tathagata.

130
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,140
Number four, mental formation.

131
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:43,540
All my attachments of likes and dislikes, love and hate, all this is not me.

132
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,540
It's just my false sense of the self.

133
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,140
I am much bigger than this.

134
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,460
I am the treasury of Tathagata.

135
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,460
Number five, all my consciousness.

136
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:55,800
Including my alaya consciousness, it's not the true me.

137
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,120
It's just a whole big complex cause and conditions going on.

138
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,120
That's not the real me.

139
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:07,580
The real me is the perfect consciousness, what we call the treasury of the Tathagata.

140
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:14,220
So if you can think of all your body and mind in this manner, you will understand non-self.

141
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,220
There's not a me.

142
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:20,580
If you reach the root of goodness in this meditation, your heart will be filled with

143
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,420
abiding joy.

144
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:27,220
Join in the dharma and you'll be free from all desires and detached from the self.

145
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:33,460
Number five, for karmic obstacles, be mindful of the Buddha.

146
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:38,800
Karmic obstacle, it means when you have all of the above, you're greedy, angry, lack

147
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:45,360
focus and ignorant, then you have strong karmic obstacle that's blocking you from enlightenment.

148
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,120
What we can do is be mindful of the Buddha.

149
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,120
This doesn't just mean chanting the Buddha's name.

150
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,120
This doesn't just mean chanting the Buddha's name.

151
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,120
This doesn't just mean chanting the Buddha's name.

152
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,500
It means recollecting on Buddha's merits.

153
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,500
For example, all Buddhas have ten general names.

154
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,500
One is called worthy of offerings.

155
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:05,580
Buddha, like an art hand who's worthy of all kinds of great offerings because they are

156
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,400
slayers of evil.

157
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:12,400
They get rid of all their afflictions and they have no secret afflictions.

158
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,460
So if you open up their mind, it's perfectly wholesome and mindful.

159
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,620
That's my favorite part.

160
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,460
So contemplate on it.

161
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,960
Think about it in great detail.

162
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,620
And then you will feel like you really want to be a Buddha.

163
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:31,500
And an art hand is also someone who is no longer subject to life and death.

164
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,500
That's also great.

165
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,360
And another name of a Buddha is called excellent trainer.

166
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:42,780
Buddha knows everybody's every lifetime of karma, their affliction, their personality.

167
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:48,700
So Buddha is able to give the right medicine, the right Dharma to each person accordingly.

168
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,800
Think about the merits of Buddha.

169
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,800
Concentrate.

170
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,200
See the benefits of the de-selected.

171
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,980
Benefit from the dry cold.

172
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,500
Know your body, know your existence.

173
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,360
Know your soul.

174
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:20,140
How you can be aware of whether you love

175
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,000
the good in one's life.

176
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,060
Ho Priya!

177
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:29,520
all phenomena are just cause and conditions in this cause and condition is empty of a self

178
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:37,000
of a me so there's no owner we do not own our body or mind there's no ownership of anything

179
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,520
it just cause and effect we need to realize emptiness so resting the mind to reach its

180
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:50,600
essence resting the mind let go of the idea of the self if you can let go of your identity

181
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:57,280
when you meditate 90% of your wandering thoughts will disappear if there's not a me there's nothing

182
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:04,240
to wonder about let go of the identity of the self then your essence will emerge your true self

183
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:11,820
your buddha nature your suchness your treasury of tathagata and will emerge then one is known

184
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:19,140
as a shaman which is a true practitioner who practice the morality concentration and wisdom

185
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,220
and who is

186
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:20,580
ascetic

187
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:26,960
who has spiritual discipline and is on the way to enlightenment so it's not hard to settle

188
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:33,360
our mind we just need to deal with our afflictions with the proper meditation and let go of the

189
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,700
idea of the self so that's the class for today thank you for listening Amitabha
