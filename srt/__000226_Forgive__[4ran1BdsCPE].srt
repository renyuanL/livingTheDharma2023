1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Today we are going to talk about forgiveness.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
How do we forgive ourselves and others of the mistakes and faults done to us?

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We are going to use the Four Noble Truths to discuss forgiveness.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The first Noble Truth is called suffering.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We are currently experiencing the suffering of having anger and resentment in our hearts.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Then we need to find out what's the causes of suffering.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What is the exact cause of this anger?

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And our goal is cessation of suffering.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We want to end this pain. We want to resolve this anger.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The path to end suffering.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What do we need to do right now to resolve this anger?

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So let's look at this in detail.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
First is suffering.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We will experience five kinds of suffering related to anger.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The first two are internal suffering.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The next two are external suffering.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And the last one is future suffering.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Internal suffering, we will suffer pain in our body.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We are likely to experience fast aging.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
If you look at the centurions, they are always happy and never get angry.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,000
If we get angry all the time, we are likely to have sickness such as cancer, heart attack, and stroke.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Number two, we will experience suffering of our mind.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The anger swallows up our peace of mind and robs us of our joy and serenity.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So it's highly destructive.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Externally, number three, we will have poor relationships.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The anger will destroy our relationship with others

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
and cause more conflicts and fights.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Number four, anger will create karma of natural disaster

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
such as fire, earthquake, and viruses.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Lastly, in the future, we will experience samsara.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
After this lifetime, we are likely to be reborn in the three evil realms

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
of animal, hungry ghost, and hell.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Especially, hell is caused by anger.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So if you look at the suffering, you will know that nothing good comes out of anger.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's highly destructive.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It only creates more pain.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Internally, it will harm our body and mind.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Externally, we will have poor relationships and create natural disasters.

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And after this lifetime, we will be reborn in the three evil realms.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Now we need to know the exact cause of our anger.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
There are also five types of anger

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
that we might experience.

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The first is angry at ourselves.

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
A lot of times, we're angry at ourselves for getting angry.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
For example, I'm holding the bodhisattva precept

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
but I got mad at my family member

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
and I'm more than mad at myself.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
But if you're mad at yourself, that's double anger.

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You're breaking the precept again.

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So what you need to do is you need to treat yourself in a friendly manner.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Talk to yourself with encouragement.

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You can do it.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You have a big heart.

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You can have no more anger.

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You're doing a good job.

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So always encourage yourself instead of getting angry at yourself.

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Number two, we might be angry at others.

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We choose the world we live in.

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You might choose to live in a hostile world

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
or you choose to live in a friendly world.

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's all up to us.

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Some people, they choose to be offended all the time.

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
They go to the market.

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
They're offended by their cashier.

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
They go to a restaurant, offended by the waiter.

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
They drive on the street and being offended by other drivers.

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Some people choose to be offended and angry at others all the time.

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Number three, we might be angry about the past.

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Sometimes we have childhood abuse that keep haunting us for the rest of our lives.

70
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Or you might just not be the favorite child in your family.

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You just keep playing the scene of your mother treating your brother better.

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And you feel inferior and not worthy of love.

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So that's angry about the past.

74
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Number four, we might be angry about the present.

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Right now, we're having lockdowns.

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Everybody is in a confined space living together.

77
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's really hard to live together in harmony when we're hanging out in a small space.

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So, you know, we might be angry about the current situation.

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Number five, we might be angry.

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
We might be angry about the future.

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You think about the future and think, oh, that co-worker is going to take over my job.

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
How dare him?

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Or that country is going to go to war with us.

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And you feel angry about that.

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So the last three, anger about the past, angry about the present, angry about the future.

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
These three are related to three kinds of distresses.

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
A is someone annoying me.

88
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Even just a mosquito biting me.

89
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Even just a mosquito biting us, we might be annoyed.

90
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Or someone who insults us in front of a large group of people, we will be annoyed.

91
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Or someone who is always late, we might be annoyed.

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So that's the first one concerning me.

93
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
B is someone annoying my loved one.

94
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
That also makes us angry.

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
For example, we might have family feuds that last for 20, 30 years.

96
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It might be the uncle or the aunt that took our money and still badmouth our parents.

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
We will get very angry at that.

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And we keep the family feud forever.

99
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
C, eulogizing my rivals.

100
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
For example, someone that's close to you, that is still a good friend with your enemy.

101
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
That will make us very upset.

102
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So angry about the past, angry about the present, angry about the future.

103
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
All times these three, A, B, and C.

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Together, we call it the nine distresses.

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Nine things we might be angry about.

106
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And if you look at all these causes, you will realize the main cause is having the ego of me, of my, and I.

107
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That's why we are experiencing the anger.

108
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
If you can just shrink the self, you will no longer feel the anger.

109
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So recognize the causes is very important that help us to cast away the anger immediately.

110
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So our goal is cessation of suffering.

111
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
We want to be able to reach number one, forgiveness.

112
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:58,000
We want to be able to completely forget ourselves and the other person of the faults and mistakes.

113
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Everybody is not yet a Buddha.

114
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So we all make mistakes.

115
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Have the big heart and be able to accept the fault and the mistake and forgive completely.

116
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
That's what we call deep healing.

117
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Only when we forgive, then we can get rid of the pain and the suffering.

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Number two, liberation from resentment.

119
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Free ourselves from all kinds of resentment.

120
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
That's the only way that your cultivation will improve.

121
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Just like if you have a lot of trash in your heart, you cannot put in new merits.

122
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Just like a warehouse.

123
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You need to throw out the old, unusable inventory before you restock and put in new inventory.

124
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So we liberate ourselves of all resentment.

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Throw it away completely.

126
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Number three is the ultimate goal of reaching nirvana.

127
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So nirvana, it actually means no samsara, no more life and death.

128
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
How do we reach that level?

129
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It means no more self, no more ego, no more defilements such as anger.

130
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That's what we call nirvana.

131
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Most importantly, what's the path to end suffering?

132
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What do we need to do to get rid of our anger?

133
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Usually we talk about the path in terms of

134
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
the three aspects of learning.

135
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Morality, concentration, and wisdom.

136
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
In this case, the morality would be compassion.

137
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
As a bodhisattva, we hold the precept of great compassion.

138
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
We love all sentient beings equally without any feeling of anger or resentment.

139
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
We need to put ourselves in other people's perspective.

140
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
That person's yelling at me because they had a bad day,

141
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
or they're sick, they have a headache,

142
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
or they just have low self-esteem.

143
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
That's how they feel better when they yell at us.

144
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So when you feel their pain, you will feel sympathy,

145
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
and you will not be angry anymore.

146
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So that is a bodhisattva's way.

147
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And a bodhisattva will sincerely pray for the other person,

148
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
will end his suffering, get rid of the pain inside of him,

149
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
and reach enlightenment and happiness.

150
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
That's great compassion.

151
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Number two,

152
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
we need to practice concentration.

153
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
This concentration means great tolerance.

154
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
In the Sutra of 42 chapters,

155
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
it says tolerance under insult is great power

156
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
because it harbors no hatred, only peace and fortitude.

157
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
When we are able to tolerate all insults

158
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
and all unfavorable situations,

159
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
that is great power and great strength.

160
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
In Japan,

161
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
there was a Zen master in a small village called Haikun.

162
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
One day,

163
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
his next-door neighbor's teenage daughter

164
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
told the parents that she was pregnant.

165
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The parents were furious,

166
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
asked her who the father was.

167
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
But the daughter wouldn't say.

168
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
After much harassment,

169
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
she finally said the father was Haikun.

170
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
The parents were furious,

171
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
went to Haikun and berated him.

172
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
All Haikun said was,

173
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Is that so?

174
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
After the child was born,

175
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
they gave the child to Haikun.

176
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
By this time,

177
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
his reputation was all ruined.

178
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Everybody despised him in the village,

179
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
but that did not trouble him.

180
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
All he did was take very good care of the child.

181
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
After a few years,

182
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
the girl finally told her parents the truth

183
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
that the father of the child

184
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
was a young man from the fish market.

185
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
The parents were embarrassed,

186
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
went to Haikun,

187
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
and apologized in great length

188
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
and begged for forgiveness.

189
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
At this time,

190
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Haikun all he did was smile

191
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
and said very calmly,

192
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Is that so?

193
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So Haikun,

194
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
he's able to endure

195
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
all kinds of false accusations

196
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
without feeling any anger inside of him.

197
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
That is great concentration

198
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
and great tolerance.

199
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Number three is wisdom.

200
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
We need to have the wisdom

201
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
of the Four Noble Truths.

202
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Knowing exactly the cause of my anger

203
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
and the suffering we're going through

204
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
and what do we need to do

205
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
to end the suffering,

206
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
that is true wisdom.

207
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
When you clearly see

208
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
all the cause and effect about everything,

209
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
that's when we will be enlightened.

210
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So this is how we use the Dharma

211
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
and use the Buddhism

212
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
to solve all our life issues.

213
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
That's a true practitioner

214
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
on the way to end samsara,

215
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
and reach nirvana.

216
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So that's the class for today.

217
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Thank you for listening.

218
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Amitabha.
