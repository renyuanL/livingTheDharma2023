1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,600
Today we are going to talk about the Fundamentals.

2
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,600
In this class, we will use the Shrogamma Sutra to understand the Fundamentals.

3
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,000
There are basically two Fundamentals.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,200
One is the Root of Beginningless Birth and Death.

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,200
The Root of Reincarnation is our Deluded Mind.

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,400
The second Fundamental is the Root of Beginningless Bodhi Nirvana.

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,400
The Root of Nirvana and Enlightenment is our Pure Mind.

8
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,000
So we need to understand the difference between the two.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Now let's look at the verses.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The Root of Beginningless Birth and Death is the Mind that ceases upon conditions

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and that you and all living beings now make use of,

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,400
taking it to be the Self-Nature.

13
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,000
This Deluded Mind ceases upon conditions.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,200
We are all very much clinging on and attached to external conditions.

15
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,200
For example, if someone praises me, I'm very happy.

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,800
If someone criticizes me, I'm very upset.

17
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,200
So that means I'm totally attached to the external conditions.

18
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,000
Every day my emotion is following what's going on externally.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,200
So if I'm attached to external conditions,

20
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,000
then no matter how much good deeds I do,

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
it is still creating reincarnation for myself.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Buddha asked Ananda,

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Why did you become a monk?

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,200
Ananda replied very honestly,

25
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,000
Because I saw your 32 characteristics of greatness,

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
which was supremely wonderful.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,200
The entire body had a shimmering transparency just like that of the crystals.

28
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,200
So is that a good reason to become a monk?

29
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,200
No, because you're basing your spiritual cultivation on someone's appearance,

30
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,200
which is going to change all the time.

31
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,200
It's not reliable.

32
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,600
That's why Buddha said that you and all living beings now make use of.

33
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,600
This you is Ananda.

34
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,600
Buddha is speaking to him.

35
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,400
And we are all like Ananda.

36
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,400
We are using the Deluded Mind as our Self-Nature.

37
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,400
And we actually lost our Self-Nature because of that.

38
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,400
The reason that Buddha expanded the Shakyamuni Sutra

39
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,400
is because Ananda,

40
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,000
he has been learning with Buddha for 12 years,

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,600
but he was still being controlled by the spell of the daughter of Mataji.

42
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,400
He almost broke the sexual misconduct precept because of her.

43
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,600
Ananda was the most learned disciple.

44
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,800
Why did this happen?

45
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,600
Because

46
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,600
he didn't find the fundamental of cultivation.

47
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,600
As if he is trying to cook rice with sand.

48
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,600
You will only get hot sand.

49
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,600
You will not get rice.

50
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,600
In order to have rice,

51
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,600
we must have rice as the ingredient.

52
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,600
So if we cultivate very hard,

53
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,600
but we are using our Deluded Mind,

54
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,600
then how can we reach Nirvana?

55
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,600
Now let's look at our Pure Mind.

56
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,600
It is the primal pure substance of beginningless bodhi nirvana.

57
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,600
It is the primal bright essence of consciousness

58
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,600
that can bring forth all conditions.

59
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,600
Because of conditions,

60
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,600
you consider it to be lost.

61
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:41,600
This Pure Mind is called primal because it is originally there.

62
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,600
It is the mind before we start perceiving the external conditions,

63
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,600
before we start thinking, judging, and discriminating.

64
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,600
That is our Pure Mind.

65
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,600
This Pure Mind actually creates all the external conditions,

66
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,600
but we don't know that.

67
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,600
We are attached to external conditions

68
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
and we lost our Pure Mind.

69
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,600
So we unjustly lost our Pure Mind.

70
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,600
It's like we are attached to a little bubble of the ocean

71
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,600
and lost the entire ocean out of ignorance.

72
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,600
So how do we know if we are using our Deluded Mind

73
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
or not?

74
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
Well, our Pure Mind,

75
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,600
in the Sutra it says,

76
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
the Deluded Mind has no substance

77
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,600
apart from the objects,

78
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,600
from the external conditions.

79
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
If this thought or this emotion

80
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,600
is coming from stimulants from outside,

81
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,600
that's your Deluded Mind.

82
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,600
If this thought actually has substance

83
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,600
apart from the objects,

84
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,600
apart from all external conditions,

85
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,600
it still exists,

86
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
that means it's your Pure Mind.

87
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,600
For example, someone asked

88
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
Yin Guang Master,

89
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,600
Have you seen anyone that went to the Pure Land?

90
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
How do you know you can go to the Pure Land?

91
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,600
Yin Guang Master answered very firmly,

92
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,600
I don't need to see anyone that went to the Pure Land.

93
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,600
Even if no one in the world chants Amitabha,

94
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,600
I will still chant Amitabha

95
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
and go to the Pure Land.

96
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Why is his faith so strong?

97
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Because he knows that chanting Amitabha

98
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
is aligning himself

99
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
with his Pure Mind.

100
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
That's what he's supposed to do.

101
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
That's who he is originally.

102
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,600
He is residing in his Pure Mind.

103
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,600
In conclusion,

104
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,600
living beings lost sight

105
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
of the original brightness.

106
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
Therefore, though they use it

107
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
to the end of their days,

108
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,600
they are unaware of it

109
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
and without intending to,

110
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
they enter the various destinies.

111
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
All of us lost sight of our Pure Mind.

112
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Even though we use it

113
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,600
and we have it

114
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,600
to the end of our day,

115
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,600
we are unaware of it.

116
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,600
That's why without intending to,

117
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
we enter the six grounds of reincarnation.

118
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
We actually don't deserve reincarnation.

119
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
We are unjustly wronged

120
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,600
into reincarnation.

121
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,600
This arising,

122
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,600
that arises.

123
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,600
Because of our ignorance

124
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,600
and deluded mind,

125
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,600
we create the twelve links

126
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,600
of dependent origination.

127
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,600
That's why we are reincarnating.

128
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,600
So Buddha tried to explain this

129
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,600
to Ananda with a very simple example.

130
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,600
Buddha raised his golden arm

131
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
and bent his five fingers

132
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
into a fist.

133
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,600
Then he asked Ananda,

134
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,600
Do you see?

135
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,600
Ananda replied,

136
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,600
Yes, I see.

137
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,600
Buddha asked,

138
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,600
What do you see?

139
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,600
Ananda replied,

140
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,600
I see your golden arm

141
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,600
and the shimmering fist.

142
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,600
Buddha then asked,

143
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,600
What do you see it with?

144
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,600
Ananda replied,

145
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,600
I see it with my mind.

146
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,600
Then Buddha very harshly berated him.

147
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,600
No, that is not your mind.

148
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,600
Ananda was startled

149
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,600
and scared.

150
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,600
He said,

151
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,600
If this is not my mind,

152
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,600
then what is it?

153
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,600
Buddha then firmly replied,

154
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,600
It is your perception of false appearances

155
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,600
based on external objects

156
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,600
that has deluded your true nature

157
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,600
and has caused you

158
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,600
from the beginningless time

159
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,600
to recognize the thief

160
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,600
as your son,

161
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,600
to lose the eternal source

162
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,600
and to undergo the wheels turning.

163
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,600
This deluded mind

164
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,600
is called the perception

165
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,600
of false appearances

166
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,600
based on external objects.

167
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,600
First we have the

168
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,600
external objects.

169
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,600
We call it the five dusts

170
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,600
form, sound,

171
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,600
odor, taste,

172
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,600
and touch.

173
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,600
Because of the external conditions

174
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,600
we create a false appearance,

175
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,600
a shadow image

176
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,600
in our own mind.

177
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,600
We keep thinking about it.

178
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,600
It becomes our perception.

179
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,600
It creates our story.

180
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,600
It creates our life.

181
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,600
That's our life consciousness.

182
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,600
That is not us,

183
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,600
but we think that's us

184
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,600
so we recognize the thief

185
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,600
as our son.

186
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,600
The deluded mind is a thief

187
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,600
that's been stealing from us

188
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,600
but we see it as our true nature,

189
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,600
our son.

190
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,600
That's why we are going through

191
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
the wheels turning,

192
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,600
the samsara.

193
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,600
18 years ago,

194
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,600
I started learning Buddhism.

195
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,600
I tried to do a lot of Buddhist work

196
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,600
and to do a lot of ceremony

197
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,600
and learn the Dharma

198
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,600
but deep down inside

199
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,600
I always felt a sense of emptiness

200
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,600
as if something is still missing

201
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,600
in my life

202
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,600
and a sense of insecurity

203
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,600
and I realized why.

204
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,600
Because I've been trying to cook rice

205
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
with sand.

206
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,600
I will only get hot sand

207
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,600
because I've been attaching

208
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,600
to the external conditions

209
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,600
to the temple, to the masters,

210
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,600
to all the students

211
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,600
and because everybody is changing

212
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,600
based on everyone's karma

213
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,600
I felt insecure.

214
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,600
Everything is changing.

215
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,600
When I realized that,

216
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,600
I finally felt complete.

217
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
I felt like I'm at home.

218
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,600
I'm now safe

219
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,600
and guarded and secure.

220
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,600
So the shragama mantra

221
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,600
is the big

222
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
white umbrella.

223
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
When we recite the mantra

224
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
we are covered by the big

225
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600
white umbrella because

226
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
we are residing in our home

227
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,600
we are safe and we are sheltered.

228
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,600
That's why the shragama

229
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
sutra is called

230
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
everything ultimately

231
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,600
indestructible.

232
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
The samadhi of suchness.

233
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Then you will realize

234
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
the deluded mind is actually

235
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
the same as the pure mind.

236
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
The mind that is dreaming

237
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
and sleeping is the mind that's

238
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
awakened. We only have

239
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,600
one mind. All you have to do

240
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
is to recognize that

241
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,600
you are dreaming. Wake up.

242
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,600
That's all you have to do.

243
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
You're naturally dwelling in your

244
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
pure mind. It doesn't mean

245
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
you won't have external conditions

246
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
of obstacles or

247
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,600
afflictions. It just means

248
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
whenever things happen

249
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,600
you will not be attached to them.

250
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
You will still be safe.

251
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,600
You will be the owner of your

252
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
own life. You will not be

253
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
affected by the outside world.

254
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Lastly, I would like to share

255
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,600
a story. There was a village

256
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,600
of 500 monkeys.

257
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,600
All 499 monkeys

258
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,600
only have one eye.

259
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
Only one has

260
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
two eyes. So everybody

261
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
laughed and poked fun at him.

262
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,600
So he grew up very depressed

263
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,600
and had very low self-esteem.

264
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,600
Until one day he

265
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,600
had the courage to go outside

266
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
the village. Once outside

267
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,600
he saw other monkeys and

268
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
much to his surprise all the other

269
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
monkeys have two eyes.

270
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
Then he realized I'm actually

271
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,600
normal. After that

272
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
he lived happily ever after.

273
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,600
So we are all

274
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,600
supposed to have two eyes

275
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,600
which means we are all supposed to be

276
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,600
dwelling in our pure

277
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,600
mind. That's who we

278
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
supposed to be. When we recite

279
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,600
the name Amitabha

280
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,600
we need to have the right

281
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,600
fundamental, our pure

282
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,600
mind. So before we start any

283
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,600
cultivation, find

284
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
our home, find our

285
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,600
pure mind. If we chant

286
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,600
Amitabha's name or cultivate

287
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,600
for the rest of our life

288
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,600
but using the deluded mind

289
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,600
then that will still be creating

290
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,600
reincarnation for

291
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
ourselves. So ponder

292
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,600
upon this deeply.

293
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,600
That's the class for today. Thank

294
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,600
you for listening. Amitabha.
