00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,520
Today we're going to keep talking about the Ten Great Vows of Universal Worthy Bodhisattva.

2
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:29,520
He is the symbol of all Bodhisattva because his heart is immeasurably broad and full of

3
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,160
love and compassion.

4
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,700
So he is the symbol of all great Bodhisattva.

5
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:40,700
He has ten great vows and last time we did the first four and now we're going to do five,

6
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,700
six and seven.

7
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:47,940
Number five is to rejoice over others' meritorious deeds.

8
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,380
This is to conquer our problem of jealousy.

9
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,840
Everybody feels jealousy sometimes, even little kids.

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,080
Now why are we jealous of others?

11
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:04,160
We're usually jealous of our peers, like our siblings or our classmates or our co-workers.

12
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,140
We usually are not jealous of our parents or people that are really young.

13
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,340
We want to be the best.

14
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,900
We want to be best among our peers.

15
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:18,960
In order to conquer that defilement, we need to feel rejoice, be happy for other people's

16
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,960
success.

17
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,960
Why?

18
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,760
Because everyone is Buddha.

19
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,020
Everybody is one entity.

20
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,920
Everybody is together as one.

21
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,340
Everyone has two rights.

22
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,500
When you realize what you have and do whatever you have to do, you move.

23
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,740
You move forward.

24
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:45,140
Now we gotta try to become one of all who is on the nieces and nephews of great people

25
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:52,200
of

26
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,200
Buddha.

27
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,740
So before we go on to the next verse.

28
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,000
One part is business and another part isçˆ±.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,800
The other part means the quality of life.

30
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:03,820
and it's part of anger. You'll never be happy. So in order to be happy, we want to be happy for

31
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:09,380
others. Their success is my success. When they're doing well, that means I'm doing well. So be happy

32
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:17,120
for others. In our Chinese history, the Chao dynasty is the longest dynasty. It lasted 800

33
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:26,380
years. Why? Because they use love and compassion and rejoice for others as their principle for

34
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:33,480
leading the country. There's an emperor and three sons. And the older son and the second oldest son,

35
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,860
they know that the father wants to give the throne to the third son. But usually you give the throne

36
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:46,040
to the oldest. So one day they just told emperor with dad, we are going to go to the mountain to

37
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:53,040
get you some herbal medicine. So they went up to the mountain, they never came back. They just left.

38
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,360
So naturally the father gave the throne,

39
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:01,480
gave the throne to the third son and the third son gave to his son who became a great emperor.

40
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:08,400
And that's why the Chao dynasty lasted 800 years, because they're always kind and sharing,

41
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,560
letting other people have their way without ever fighting for things. We want to be compassionate

42
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:21,880
and rejoice for other people's success. That's a bodhisattvas way, the sixth is to request the

43
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,840
turning of the Dharma wheel. What's requesting the turning of Dharma wheel? The Dharma wheel is the

44
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,160
the turning of the Dharma wheel it's like what you're doing right now when

45
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,480
you're listening to the Dharma teaching that's requesting the turning of the

46
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,720
Dharma wheel Dharma is Buddha's teaching why do we call it the Dharma because the

47
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,860
Dharma is like a wheel when you roll over something that means you roll over

48
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:51,820
all your defilements such as jealousy or anger or greediness you roll over so you

49
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,360
get rid of all your problems okay so that's what Dharma is for so by

50
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,240
listening to the Dharma you are requesting it how do you request it you

51
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:06,220
just keep doing and learning the Dharma and use it in your daily life

52
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:11,980
so in the Lotus Sutra it says in order to teach the Lotus Sutra you must do

53
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:16,840
three things what are the three things in your everyday life this is what you

54
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,620
do you have to enter the Buddha's room you have to where

55
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:21,640
you are

56
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:21,800
you have to wear

57
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:28,600
the buddha's clothes you have to sit in buddha's seat what does that mean buddha's room what's

58
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:35,400
inter buddha's room buddha's room is great compassion his room his heart is full of

59
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:41,160
compassion for other not jealous for other but always compassionate full of love okay so that's

60
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:47,260
buddha's room and we should also wear buddha's clothes every day we get up and we wear clothes

61
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:53,580
what kind of clothes do we wear we should wear the clothes of tolerance and perseverance that's

62
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:59,820
buddha's clothing now be tolerant of others not be jealous no matter what other people do to us

63
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:05,660
we don't get angry no we let them be and be kind and compassionate so have tolerance and

64
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:12,860
perseverance that's buddha's clothing the third is called see sit in buddha's seats what's the buddha

65
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,540
see buddha see is the truth about emptiness emptiness is the truth about emptiness emptiness

66
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:24,780
emptiness means letting go of the idea of the self everything is forever changing there is not

67
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:32,700
an idea called me that you should have an ego for or be attached to you should let go of all

68
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:40,780
your attachments about things that way you can have true great compassion you have true tolerance

69
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:47,260
and perseverance only when you sit in the sea of emptiness that's your wisdom so everywhere

70
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:53,800
day we should do these three things that is turning the dharma wheel the third is to request

71
00:05:53,800 --> 00:06:02,820
that the buddhas remain in the world chakramoni buddha was on this earth in india 2600 years ago

72
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:09,180
he is no longer here what do we mean by requesting the buddha to remain in the world how do we make

73
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:15,700
the buddha remain in the world by practicing his dharma if you practice his dharma you're requesting

74
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:22,160
him to live in this world so by you cultivating and practicing that's requesting his presence

75
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:29,300
right now in your heart there's a great story when chakramoni buddha was alive one time he was

76
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:36,080
going to the heaven to teach his mom about buddhism because his mom is in heaven so he went

77
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,640
up to heaven for three months and when he was about to come back everybody knew oh by chakramoni

78
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,580
buddha is coming back so all his disciples and everybody they

79
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:45,680
were like oh my god he's coming back he's coming back he's coming back he's coming back

80
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:45,700
he's coming back he's coming back he's coming back he's coming back he's coming back he's coming back

81
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:50,500
try to be the first one to greet him when he comes back so everybody's trying really hard

82
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:57,700
to be the first one to see him one of his students so bhuti he he was in his cave meditating he has

83
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:03,220
psychic power so he knew that buddha was coming back he said to himself should i go fight with

84
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:10,580
everybody to see buddha first or should i stay in my cave and meditate about emptiness because

85
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:15,680
he is supposed to be the one that understands emptiness the most he realized for himself

86
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:22,220
i shouldn't go fight to be the first one to see buddha i should just remain in my cave and meditate

87
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:29,580
so that's exactly what he did he stayed in his cave and meditate on emptiness at the same time

88
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:35,680
there was a nun she really wanted to be the first one to see buddha but she's a woman most likely she

89
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,860
won't be the first one but she has very strong supernatural power so she transformed into a king

90
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:45,480
so the king has the right to see buddha first and then she

91
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:51,360
bowed to the buddha as the king bowed to buddha buddha knew that was the nun and you know what

92
00:07:51,360 --> 00:08:00,000
buddha said to her he said you are not the one that saw me first who saw me first saw buddhi

93
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:09,040
why because he really received my dharma about emptiness you don't need to go to find your

94
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:15,360
spiritual guru or find people to help you you have the dharma inside your heart and buddha

95
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:23,360
is alive so through teaching of buddha's emptiness inside your heart detach from the idea of the ego

96
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,920
and the self and let your great compassion come out then that's the bodhisattva way so today we

97
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:36,840
learned three things first is to rejoice over other people's marital seas the second is to

98
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:42,560
request the turning of the dharma wheel the third is to request that the buddha remain in the world

99
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,560
so next time we're gonna finish

100
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,760
that's it for today thank you for listening omitofo
