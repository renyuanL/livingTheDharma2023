25

world.

26
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So

27
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,300
we are going to talk about the Four Noble Truths. What do we mean by noble? Noble means

28
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:44,080
we can actually get back to our Buddha nature. Buddha, when he was a prince, he left the

29
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:50,740
kingdom. He wants to know why there is death. How come we have to suffer? Even as a prince,

30
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:56,140
he has to go through life and death and illness. He's like, I don't want to go through this.

31
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:01,760
Is there any way to end suffering? So he really wants to find out how do we end suffering.

32
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:08,360
So he left the kingdom and sat in the woods and tried to figure it out. At the time, there

33
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,260
were a lot of different religions helping him go into meditation. But he found out that's

34
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:19,780
not the answer. Nobody told him why there is suffering. Then for six years, he tried

35
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:25,940
to starve himself. Every day, he ate one grain of sesame, a little sesame.

36
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:33,600
So every day, he ate one grain. He did that for six years. And then every day, he just

37
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:40,400
sat and meditated, trying to figure out what is the truth about life. One day, when he

38
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:47,580
was 30 years old, he sat under the Bodhi tree. He came to full realization. Oh, this is the

39
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:52,480
truth about life. After he realized, oh, this is the truth about life, he started teaching.

40
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:02,180
He passed away when he was 80. So he taught for 49 to 50 years. Then he taught, how do

41
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:06,560
we get back to our true Buddha nature? When he first started teaching, this is what he

42
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,420
taught. For 49 years, that's what he taught. Mainly, that's what he taught. So that's the

43
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:18,820
most important Dharma wheel in Buddhism. The Four Noble Truths, the truth about our lives.

44
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:24,720
This is what you need to contemplate in order for you to reach your enlightenment. The first

45
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,820
one and the second one.

46
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:31,240
The first one is a group. The third and the fourth is a different group. We're trying

47
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:38,600
to go from here to here. That's the purpose. We're going from here to here. And Buddha

48
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:45,440
is very smart. He gives us the result first, then the cause. The result first, then the

49
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,640
cause. He doesn't give us the cause and then the result. To let us know how we are right

50
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,920
now, what's the cause of it, just like someone is sick.

51
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:02,880
What's the cause of the sickness? How does he cure himself? What kind of medicine does

52
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,840
he take? So that's the Four Noble Truths.

53
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:15,840
The first one is what is our sickness right now? It's called suffering. You have to realize

54
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:23,640
that we live in the world of suffering. There are three kinds of suffering. The first one

55
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,460
is ordinary suffering.

56
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:33,160
means the suffering that we can all feel. For example, someone hit you, it hurts. That's

57
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,560
ordinary. You know that it's pain, that it's suffering. Or you get sick, that's ordinary

58
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,340
suffering. A dog would know, a cat would know, everybody would know. So that's not really

59
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:51,480
a truth or a wisdom, right? But the second kind of suffering is harder to realize. It's

60
00:03:51,480 --> 00:04:00,200
called the suffering of changes. Good things will become suffering. If you ate a dumpling,

61
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:08,600
you really like dumpling. You ate one, it tastes very good. If you ate a hundred, will

62
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:18,300
you still be happy? No. Because why? Ate too much. Happiness became suffering. That's

63
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,180
called suffering of changes.

64
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:30,200
So you have to realize every happiness eventually will become suffering. So that's the second

65
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:36,800
truth about suffering. Every enjoyment you're having right now, one day it will become bad

66
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:44,200
because it will not last. Everything is impermanent. Impermanence is a top teaching of Buddhism.

67
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:49,280
So we'll talk about that later. So that's the suffering of changes. The third kind is

68
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:49,880
called pervasive happiness.

69
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:58,280
Pervasive means contamination of our body and mind. Do you guys remember the very first

70
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:06,140
class? We talked about the five skandhas. The first one is our form, which is our body.

71
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:13,440
The second one is our feelings. We're made of our feelings. We feel hot or cold or happy

72
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:19,280
or sad, pleasure, displeasure. So that's the second one. The third one is our perception,

73
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:25,780
how we perceive things. That makes up what we think we are. And the fourth one is our

74
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:33,560
mental formation. Perception going into a deeper level, it becomes a very attached thought.

75
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:40,420
It's called mental formation. The last one is your consciousness. That makes up your

76
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:48,420
body and your mind. Do you realize your five skandhas, they're pervasive. They're always

77
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,120
moving.

78
00:05:49,280 --> 00:06:00,280
Always changing. Is there a moment that you stop your mind? No. It's really hard to stop

79
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:05,320
our mind. So that's a kind of suffering. If you don't meditate, you don't understand how

80
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:10,760
sad it is that we're always having wandering thoughts. It's really a suffering. Like to

81
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:17,220
me, it's a big suffering. So that's called pervasive suffering. Not a lot of people get

82
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,280
the second or the third suffering.

83
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:25,160
Everybody only knows the ordinary suffering. So now you need to know all three. What I

84
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:32,780
mean, know, you need to be fully aware of it, fully conscious of it, fully accept it

85
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:40,280
and deal with it. It takes a very strong person to know your own suffering and you can see

86
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:47,120
everybody when everybody is suffering. That's the first truth. You have to know it wholeheartedly

87
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,120
what suffering is.

89
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,160
If you don't know it, you don't know how to end it. You have to know it in order to end

90
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,160
it.

91
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:03,160
The second noble truth is cause of suffering. Do you know why we keep having sufferings?

92
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:14,160
Why? The main cause is actually because of our own ego, our selfishness. If there's not

93
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,160
a concept of self, when someone hit me, would I be okay?

94
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:26,240
Would I be upset? No. If I don't exist, then it doesn't hurt, right? It doesn't really

95
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,240
affect me.

96
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:33,160
So the main problem is the idea of the ego, of the self, that we take on this identity.

97
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,960
When we're born, people taught us, you know, your name is this and that, and this is who

98
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:43,160
you are and everything about you. Okay, we take on this identity and then when anybody

99
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:49,160
hurts us, we get upset. This is the cause of why all the suffering comes in. This is

100
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,160
our ego.

101
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:58,480
So mainly there are three roots or causes of our ego. The first one is greed. We always

102
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:06,700
want more because there's the idea of self. Because of me, I want more money, I want more

103
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:15,820
fame, I want more food, I want more sleep, or I want more relationships because we're

104
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,120
always wanting more.

105
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,120
. . . . . . . . . . . . . .

106
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:25,580
The fact that you want more is why there's suffering. Okay. If you don't want more , there's

107
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,240
no suffering. My favorite thing is to stay in the ego

108
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,240
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

109
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,240
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

110
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,240
So that's the first cause.

111
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,240
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

112
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:40,560
you're greedy if you don't get what you want it becomes anger okay anything that you want

113
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:50,560
you don't get you become angry okay so this two is uh one after another okay and the third one

114
00:08:50,560 --> 00:09:03,360
is ignorance not understanding that there's no self that's our main ignorance we think

115
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:11,200
we should be selfish because there's real me my car my mom my house my everything

116
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:20,480
but that's not me i am the universal power i'm the buddha nature you are actually the big ocean

117
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:27,360
but you take on this little bubble as yourself that's our main ignorance we don't understand

118
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,600
the truth about our lives that's why we have this kind of result because of the cause we have this

119
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:40,560
result we're trying to get out of it we're trying to get out of these two and go here what's the

120
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:48,720
result that we want to get to cessation of suffering or the ending of suffering suffering

121
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,000
can end

122
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,360
once and for all nirvana or you can call it enlightenment

123
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:05,680
or you can call it the let go of the ego right there's no ego there's no suffering

124
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:13,440
so nirvana is what it's not a place it's not a place you go to it's when you let go of your own

125
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:20,160
ego then you reach there you don't really really have to meditate to reach there and you don't have

126
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,240
all these supernatural powers for you to reach nirvana

127
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:31,840
it's just for you to get this wisdom to let go of this ego that's all okay that's what buddha

128
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,000
realized we're trying to get to this place where there's no greed anger ignorance that's our

129
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:44,380
purpose that's our goal then you would be ultimately happy absolute happiness

130
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,560
you will be ultimately happy

131
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,880
it's not really duality of happiness

132
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,340
like a happy or good or both.

133
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,200
that's just three innumerable reasons because we see one of sun.

134
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:57,200
bad it's just an absolute happiness how do we get here how do we get here we have to cultivate the

135
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:05,880
fourth one the path to end suffering there is a way the path means a method what kind of method

136
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:15,660
do we use to reach nirvana there are three methods that we use in buddhism the first one is precepts

137
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:22,540
the second one is concentration the third one is wisdom that's the only three things we try to

138
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:30,820
cultivate in buddhism first we follow precepts precepts are rules that buddha said for his

139
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:40,960
disciples you follow these rules and you will have less suffering what are the rules okay there are

140
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:45,300
five basic rules the first one is

141
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:45,640
nirvana

142
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:52,640
the second one is no killing

143
00:11:52,640 --> 00:12:01,440
if you don't kill other beings you won't have people killing you you won't have sickness

144
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:08,960
sickness comes from your karma from killing others that's why we try to be vegetarian

145
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:15,280
okay so first precept is no killing the second precept is no stealing

146
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:28,760
that includes taxes or anything okay so that is anything it's not just oh i go steal someone's stuff

147
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:35,260
you know no that includes lying on the taxes there's a sale in the mall every family gets one

148
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:42,360
three things and you have all your five families go there and get five that's

149
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:48,360
That's the form of stealing. It can be very, very small. It can be very, very big. But it has karma.

150
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,360
And it all comes back to you in the form of suffering, sooner or later.

151
00:12:53,360 --> 00:13:00,360
So Buddha said you have to follow this precept for you to be in happiness without any suffering.

152
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:05,360
It's to protect us. It's not to limit us from doing things. It's to protect us.

153
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:13,360
The third one is no sexual misconduct.

154
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:19,360
When you're married, you don't go outside and have other relationships.

155
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,360
It's not proper, but it can be very, very small, too.

156
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:32,360
For example, you look at someone you like and you start flirting. Does that count? It does.

157
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,360
Even if you didn't do anything, you start to just have more.

158
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:41,360
Talks. That is also a form of sexual misconduct.

159
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,360
So the fourth one is no lying.

160
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,360
When you say things that are exaggeration.

161
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,360
You know, like people that sell cars.

162
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,360
They say everything is a great car or whatever.

163
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,360
So that is still kind of lying.

164
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,360
The fifth is no alcohol.

165
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:14,360
Because when you drink, when you drink, it's not alcohol itself that is a sin.

166
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:22,360
Because when you're intoxicated, you're more likely to kill, to steal, to have sexual misconduct and to lie.

167
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:27,360
That's why he made this rule to prevent from doing the first four.

168
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,360
So first, hold precepts.

169
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,360
Then you're more likely to go into deep concentration.

170
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:39,360
If I have a lot of defilements and I have a lot of these bad karmas,

171
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,360
when I sit there, I cannot go into deep concentration.

172
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,360
Because you have a lot of wandering thoughts.

173
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,360
And not just wandering thoughts, you have a lot of bad thoughts.

174
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,360
Okay, so you guys are all very good people, you know, already.

175
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,360
For you to be able to sit here.

176
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,360
To go into deep concentration, first you gotta withhold precepts.

177
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,360
Then you can go into samadhi or deep concentration.

178
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,360
That's what we're doing right now.

179
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,360
When we're trying to meditate for hours or hours, you know, and persistent at it.

180
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,360
This is from persistency.

181
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,360
You keep doing it, you'll be good at it.

182
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,360
Practice makes perfect.

183
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,360
You know, that's what concentration is, okay?

184
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,360
So the last one is wisdom.

185
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,360
What kind of wisdom?

186
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:32,360
The true wisdom is to understand that there's no self.

187
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,360
That's real wisdom.

188
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,360
When you can go past yourself,

189
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,360
when someone is rude to you,

190
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,360
you can actually tell yourself,

191
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,360
there's not a self that I'm being offended to.

192
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,360
If there's not self.

193
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,360
Who is being offended?

194
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,360
Nobody.

195
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,360
Okay, so it takes a great person with great wisdom

196
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,360
to be able to let go of the self.

197
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,360
When you reach this wisdom, or we call enlightenment,

198
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,360
you will reach nirvana.

199
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,360
This is what we call nirvana.

200
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,360
And this is what Buddha did.

201
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,360
That's what he did.

202
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,360
That's what he accomplished in his life.

203
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,360
And that's what he tried to teach us for 49 years.

204
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,360
He was in India.

205
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,360
He was a real person, a real prince,

206
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,360
2,600 years ago.

207
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,360
And his dharma is still with us today

208
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,360
because he's our teacher.

209
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,360
We can all go back to our true Buddha nature

210
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,360
if we can just start cultivating,

211
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,360
let go of the self,

212
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,360
and soon enough we will reach nirvana.

213
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,360
Everybody can get here,

214
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,360
but you have to cultivate.

215
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,360
Soon enough we will be away from all kinds of suffering

216
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,360
and all kinds of greed, anger, ignorance,

217
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,360
and all the defilements.

218
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,360
That's what we're trying to do.

219
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,360
Thank you very much for listening.

220
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,360
That's it for today.

221
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,360
Goodbye.
