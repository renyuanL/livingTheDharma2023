1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Today we are going to talk about Tiantai Buddhism.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This is a major type of Buddhism founded in China by Master Zhi Yi,

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
who lived in the Tiantai Mountain in the Zhezhou Province, therefore the name Tiantai.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This school of Buddhism is based off the Lotus Sutra,

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
which incorporates all Buddha's teachings and it emphasizes on the one Buddha vehicle,

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
which means that we all inherently have the absolute mind, the Buddha nature,

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and we are meant to reach Buddhahood.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Master Zhi Yi, he is famous for his ranking of the Buddha's teachings into five periods and eight teachings.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Now let's first look at the five periods.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The first period is the Aventasaka period, that is the Flower Adornment Sutra.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
When Buddha first became enlightened, that's what he really wanted to share with us,

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
is the state of the Buddha, the incredible nature of their mind.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
This is an exposition of Buddha's and Bodhisattva's, their way of reaching enlightenment,

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
their incredible state of being a Buddha.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
This is all about the broadness of our mind.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
We call it the Dharma Tattoo.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Our mind is the center of the universe, the vast entire Dharma realm,

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and the vast emptiness is our mind.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Everyone in this universe is one with us.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
That's the grandness of our mind.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So this is the king of all kings of all Buddhism scriptures.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Buddha really wanted to share with us.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
However, Buddha realized not all sentient beings

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
can believe or understand this kind of profound teaching.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Therefore, he decided to change his teaching to the Agamas period,

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
expounding the four Agama Sutras.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The Long Agama Sutra,

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
two is the Medium Length Agama Sutra,

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
the Miscellaneous Agama Sutra,

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
the last one is Increasing by One Agama Sutra.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
This is all Theravada Buddhism teaching us

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
how to get rid of the self and be out of reincarnation.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Their focus is to become an Arhat.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
These people, they are not interested in becoming a Bodhisattva

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
to save sentient beings or reach Buddhahood.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
They just want to leave the six realms of reincarnation.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So Buddha is tailoring his teaching toward these kind of people.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Therefore, he has this period of teaching.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
But that's not what he really wanted to teach.

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So he moved on to the third period,

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Vipohya period.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's the expansive period.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Now there's extensive Mahayana teaching coming out.

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
This is the period where we learn about the Pure Land Buddhism.

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
All the Pure Land Sutras are from this period.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And also Mahayana teaching such as the Mimalakirti Sutra.

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It talks about a layman practitioner with incredible wisdom

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
that expanded Mahayana.

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And also Mahayana teaching such as non-dualism.

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
There's no dualism in anything,

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
not the subject or the object,

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
not the self, not the selfless.

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
There's just one Buddha nature.

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The fourth period is the Prajna period.

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Prajna is wisdom.

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
We want to move toward the wisdom of true emptiness.

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
This is not the emptiness in the Dravata Buddhism.

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
This is all conditioned existence are empty in its nature.

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
This includes the Heart Sutra, the Diamond Sutra,

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
that really help us to let go.

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Let go of all our attachment to the world of form,

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
to all the worldly appearances.

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So Prajna is like the light that is getting rid of our ignorance.

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
That's major Mahayana teaching.

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Then we move on to the Dharma Ponderic Narvana teaching.

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's the Lotus Sutra.

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And the Nirvana Sutra.

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Buddha shared this at the end of his life

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
because there's no time left.

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What he really wanted to say is the one Buddha vehicle.

71
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
We all have the Buddha nature within us.

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
We are supposed to be Buddhas.

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
We're not supposed to just be Arhat or Pratyekabuddha

74
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
and not even Bodhisattvas.

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
We are supposed to reach Buddhahood

76
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
and reach final enlightenment.

77
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
These five periods of teaching,

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
oftentimes we say this is the first 21 days

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
after Buddha became enlightened.

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
This is 12 years of the Agama's teaching,

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
8 years of the Valpola teaching,

82
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
and 22 years of the Prajna teaching.

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And the last 7 years is the Lotus Sutra

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
and the Nirvana Sutra.

85
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But it's not necessarily in this order

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
because Buddha is very flexible.

87
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Depending on the capacity of the student at the time,

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
he will expand all kinds of teaching

89
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
throughout his 49 years.

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So these five periods of teaching in the Nirvana Sutra,

91
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
it is the analogy of the milk.

92
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
When Buddha first expanded the Avanthasaka Sutra,

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
it's like freshly squeezed milk out of the cow.

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
But not everybody can accept.

95
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So Buddha moved on to the Agama's period.

96
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
This is like turning the milk into cream

97
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
so people are more likely to accept.

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Then we turn to the Vipolya period.

99
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
That's like turning the cream into curd.

100
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Curd is coagulated.

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Sour milk is more processed for intake.

102
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Then we move on to the Prajna period.

103
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's like turning the curd into butter.

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So it's even more refined.

105
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Lastly is the Dharmapanduruk period.

106
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
That's like the ghee.

107
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Ghee is the most refined type of fat or oil

108
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
used for cooking in India.

109
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's not found here.

110
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
But that's supposed to be the more refined

111
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
and most delicious form of milk you can find.

112
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
That's describing the preciousness of the Lotus Sutra.

113
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So this is the five periods in this state of richness

114
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
of Buddha's teaching.

115
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
We move on to the eight teachings.

116
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It consists of the fourfold doctrines of conversion

117
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
and fourfold methods of conversion.

118
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Let's first talk about the fourfold doctrines of conversion.

119
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The first one is Tripitaka.

120
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
This is the Dravata Buddhism.

121
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
We call it the store teaching.

122
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It consists of the three canons of Buddhism.

123
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Sutra, Vanaya, and Shastras.

124
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Sutra means concentration.

125
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Vanaya means precepts.

126
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And Shastra means wisdom.

127
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's not apart from the three aspects of learning

128
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
of precepts, concentration, and wisdom

129
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
to get rid of our greed, anger, and ignorance.

130
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So Dravata Buddhists are very firm in this practice.

131
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
They really want to become an Arhat

132
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
and be out of the six realms of reincarnation.

133
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Then Buddha has the common teaching.

134
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Common also means shared teaching.

135
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So it's common to the Dravata vehicle

136
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
and the great vehicle, the Mahayana.

137
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
This includes the Vipoya period

138
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
and the Prajna period.

139
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
All these are common to trying to help

140
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
all the Dravata Buddhists

141
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
to get to know Mahayana Buddhism.

142
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So it's a lot about Prajna, about emptiness.

143
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
When you realize real emptiness,

144
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
you will realize reincarnation, samsara, and nirvana.

145
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's both empty in nature.

146
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So you get rid of all your attachment to the Dharma as well.

147
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Then there's the distinctive teaching.

148
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's special teaching only for the Bodhisattvas.

149
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Help all sentient beings become enlightened.

150
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So this is a distinctive teaching.

151
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It also includes Vipoya period and the Prajna period.

152
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
A lot of it is like the conscious only school of Buddhism

153
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
that really help us delve into

154
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
the workings of our mind

155
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
and to bring ourselves out of the deluded consciousness

156
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
into our pure nature, our pure wisdom.

157
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Finally, we have the complete teaching.

158
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's like the Lotus Sutra

159
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
that is telling us we are perfect and complete

160
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
in our Buddha nature.

161
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
There's nothing else we need.

162
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
We just need to know that we have the true nature.

163
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
We have the absolute mind just as Buddha.

164
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So Buddha's teaching,

165
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
it looks like there's many different types of teaching,

166
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
but there's only one flavor, one way

167
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
that is a complete, perfect teaching.

168
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
We are all supposed to reach supreme, perfect enlightenment,

169
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
anuttaro sammyo sambodhi.

170
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
The first three types of doctrine

171
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
are all expedient ways.

172
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
They're skillful means of Buddha brought about

173
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
because everybody has different capacities of learning,

174
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
have different interests,

175
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
that's why Buddha has to use these teachings

176
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
to help us to start learning Buddhism.

177
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But what he really wants us to learn

178
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
is the real teaching.

179
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Every day you should understand

180
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
that you are a Buddha.

181
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It doesn't matter what you practice anymore.

182
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
If you are Pure Land Buddhist,

183
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
when you chant Amitabha,

184
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
the mind that is chanting Amitabha

185
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
is the mind of the Buddha.

186
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You are Amitabha.

187
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
If you are pure,

188
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
if you are a Zen practitioner,

189
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
you meditate,

190
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
you meditate to go inward into your true mind.

191
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
All you want to do is to go inside

192
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
and find your absolute mind.

193
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So it doesn't matter

194
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
which kind of school of Buddhism you practice,

195
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
the only goal is to reach Buddhahood.

196
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
In this Lotus Sutra,

197
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
in this Tiantai Buddhism,

198
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
it's very clear in helping us

199
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
find our true Buddha nature.

200
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's called exposing the expedient

201
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
and revealing the real.

202
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Take away all the expedient means

203
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
at the end,

204
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
just reveal the real teaching.

205
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Now let's look at the four full

206
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
methods of conversion.

207
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
These are like the ways Buddha has teaching.

208
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
The first one is the certain teaching,

209
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
the immediate enlightenment.

210
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Just like expanded in the Aventasaka Sutra,

211
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
we are the Dharma taught to,

212
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
the Buddha nature.

213
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The entire universe is us.

214
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Our mind is the Buddha.

215
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
The gradual teaching,

216
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
that's the Agama's period,

217
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
the Valpoa period,

218
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
and the Prajna period.

219
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Beginning gradual,

220
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
the middle gradual,

221
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
and the final gradual.

222
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Little by little,

223
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
bringing you to Buddhahood,

224
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
to enlightenment.

225
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's not the certain teaching.

226
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Then we have the secret

227
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
and the variable.

228
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
The certain is the Aventasaka.

229
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
The gradual is two, three, and four.

230
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The secret and the variable

231
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
is all first four.

232
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
The Lotus Sutra is completely

233
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
separate from these four.

234
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
So what is the secret teaching?

235
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Sometimes when Buddha expounds Dharma

236
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
in the audience,

237
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Buddha will transmit some teaching

238
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
through his psychic power

239
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
to certain students

240
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
that he will reach enlightenment

241
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
in a secret manner.

242
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Only Buddha can do this.

243
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
No one else in the audience

244
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
will know what Buddha is doing

245
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
to that student,

246
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
except the student himself.

247
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Then there is the variable teaching.

248
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Variable teaching is out in the open.

249
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Different students learn different things,

250
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
even in the same Dharma teaching.

251
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
For example,

252
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
in the Mahayana teaching,

253
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
you can have a Theravada enlightenment.

254
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
In the Triyagama Sutra,

255
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
the daughter of Mantanji,

256
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
she heard the Mahayana teaching

257
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
of the Triyagama Sutra,

258
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
she became an art hack.

259
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
So everybody can reach different state

260
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
from listening to Mahayana teaching.

261
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
They might have a Theravada enlightenment

262
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
or you learn the Gamma Sutra

263
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
and you have a Mahayana enlightenment.

264
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So everybody varies

265
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
depending on their capacities

266
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
and their liking.

267
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
These are four methods of teaching

268
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
but what about the Lotus Sutra?

269
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's beyond certain.

270
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's beyond gradual.

271
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It has no secrets

272
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
and has no variables.

273
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
When you learn the Lotus Sutra,

274
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
there's only one teaching

275
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
which is the perfect complete teaching.

276
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You will not learn anything else

277
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
but the fact that you are supposed to be a Buddha.

278
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It's very, very firm,

279
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
very sure.

280
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Buddha gives a lot of hope

281
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
and faith

282
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
that we are supposed to be Buddhas.

283
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Supreme Perfect Enlightenment

284
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Annyo Toro Sama Sampodhi

285
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
is what we're supposed to be.

286
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
This is the perfect teaching.

287
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
That's what Tiantai Buddhism is all about.

288
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It has this extensive way

289
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
of ranking Buddha's teaching

290
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
just to let us know

291
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
how important the complete teaching is.

292
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So it goes to this very, very extensive system

293
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
just to point out

294
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
that we are supposed to reach Buddhahood.

295
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Lastly, I want to share a parable

296
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
from the Lotus Sutra.

297
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
There is a king

298
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
that always rewards his soldiers

299
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
by giving them lavish presents

300
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
such as big houses, clothing,

301
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
treasures of gold and silver.

302
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
But he has this precious jewel

303
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
in his topknot

304
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
that he does not give to anybody.

305
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Only if there's a soldier

306
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
that is perfect in his combat

307
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
and is able to triumph through all evils

308
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
then he will give away

309
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
this perfect jewel to him.

310
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
So what does this mean?

311
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
The king is Shakyamuni Buddha.

312
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
All the lavish presents,

313
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
they are like his teaching

314
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
before the Lotus Sutra.

315
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
They are only precious teachings

316
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
for us to learn Buddhism

317
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
but they are nothing like

318
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
the precious jewel in his topknot.

319
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
That's like the Lotus Sutra.

320
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
He only gives it

321
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
when it's the right time

322
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
and the right condition

323
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
because it's so precious.

324
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
We wouldn't understand

325
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
until you learn all these

326
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
and you realize what's most valuable.

327
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Do not let our teacher down.

328
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
He really wants us to reach Buddhahood.

329
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Do not waste your life away

330
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
working on the mundane world

331
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
and not having any spiritual enlightenment.

332
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You can use all kinds of teachings.

333
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
They will help you

334
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
to reach Buddhahood.

335
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
So it doesn't matter what you practice.

336
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
They are all causes

337
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
for you to reach Buddhahood.

338
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
So the Lotus means cause

339
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
and the effect happen at the same time.

340
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So it doesn't matter

341
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
if you are a Theravada Buddhist,

342
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
you are practicing your precepts,

343
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
concentration and wisdom.

344
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
At that time,

345
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
your Buddhahood is coming into fruition.

346
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
There's no doubt about it.

347
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The cause and the effect,

348
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
they happen simultaneously.

349
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
All teachings will bring you

350
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
to Buddhahood eventually.

351
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's just sooner or later.

352
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
So believe in Buddha's teaching.

353
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Get rid of our greed,

354
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
anger and ignorance

355
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
and let our absolute mind come out.

356
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Then we are really the person

357
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
that the king gave away

358
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
the precious jewel in his top knot to.

359
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Thank you for listening.

360
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Amitabha.
