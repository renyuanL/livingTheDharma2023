1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Today we are going to talk about Samantabhadra Bodhisattva.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
His name also means universal, worthy. Universal because his way pervades everywhere.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Worthy because his conduct is identical to the conduct of the foremost sages.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Now let's look at ten great vows.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Number one, to pay respect to all Buddhas.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
With the awesome spiritual power of Samantabhadra's vow, I appear at the same time before every Tathagata,

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and in transformed body as numerous as most of us in all lands, bow to the Buddhas as numerous as most of us in all lands.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So we use bowing to show our respect.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This bowing is not bowing to a statue, it's bowing to the true nature within all of us.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Every Buddha has three types of bodies.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
One is the Dharma body, that's the principle and nature of the original enlightenment.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Number two is the reward body, that's the perfect wisdom of the initial enlightenment.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Number three is the transformation body, that's the compassionate appearance responding to living beings.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Usually we use the example of Aporo.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The perfect round essence of the pearl is like the Dharma body.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The pure light emitted from the pearl is like the reward body.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And the reflection of the pearl is like the transformation body.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The three are not one and not yet different.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
They are not one because they are three.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
They are not different because they are from one Buddha.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
We all have the three types of bodies.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
As long as we cast out our confusion and deluded mind, we immediately return to the three bodies.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Therefore, we are respecting our own three bodies and respecting the three bodies that's in all sentient beings.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Therefore, an enlightened person will always be loving and respectful toward all sentient beings equally.

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Number two, to praise the Tathagatas.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
With oceans of sound are everywhere left for words and phrases, wonderful and endless,

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
which now and through all the eons of the future,

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
praise the wide deep sea of Buddha's name.

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Number three, to praise Amitabha's merit and virtues.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We use our voice to praise Buddha's wisdom, compassion, and his three bodies.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
That's why when we chant the name Amitabha, we are praising Amitabha's merit and virtues.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
We are also praising the merit and virtues of our own Buddha nature.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
When you understand your true nature, all the sounds of the rain, of the wind, of the cars, of the birds,

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
they are all praising the Tathagata.

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Number three, to make abundant offerings.

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
With a vast, great, supremely liberated mind,

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I believe in all the Buddhas of the three periods of time

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
with the strength of Samantabhadra's conduct and vows.

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I make offerings to all the Tathagatas everywhere.

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Because Samantabhadra's heart is so big, whatever he offers will multiply infinitely

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and be offered to all the Buddhas everywhere.

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So we want to embrace the vast emptiness and accommodate the infinitude,

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
which means our heart is so infinite.

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
We are able to tolerate, accept all sentient beings and all things.

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So we want to have a big heart, able to give everything that we can and give offerings.

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Number four, to repent and confess karmic obstacles.

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
For all the evil deeds I have done in the past, created by my body, mouth, and mind,

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
from beginningless greed, anger, and delusion, I now know shame and repent them all.

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
We want to repent all our sins.

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The worst is that we do not know our own selfishness that's blocking our Buddha nature.

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
We want to be awakened.

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But we should know that the original enlightenment exists originally,

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
and the non-enlightenment originally does not exist.

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So our sins and our afflictions do not exist in the first place.

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So it's easy for us to repent when we know what is real and what is not.

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Number five, to rejoice in virtues.

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I rejoice in the merits and virtues of all beings in the ten directions,

58
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
from the most humble to the Arhats, Pratyekabuddhas, Bodhisattvas, and all the Tathagatas.

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I rejoice in all the merits of the ten Dharma rounds.

60
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Even hell beings, they have merits.

61
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So do not look down on any sentient beings.

62
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Moreover, we do not want to be jealous of others,

63
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
because the ten Dharma rounds is created by our own mind.

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
All sentient beings are us.

65
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Know this for a fact.

66
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That way we can eradicate our jealousy.

67
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Number six, to request the turning of the Dharma wheel.

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Before the lengths of the world of the ten directions who have just accomplished Supreme Bodhi,

69
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I now request and beseech them all to turn the foremost and wondrous Dharma wheel.

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
We want to request Buddha to turn the Dharma wheel.

71
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Dharma is Buddha's teaching to help us to become enlightened.

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But the Dharma wheel is actually inside all of us.

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
By contemplating on the Dharma and practicing accordingly,

74
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
we are turning the Dharma wheel of our mind.

75
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Number seven, to request the Buddhas to remain in the world.

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
If there are Buddhas who wish for nirvana,

77
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I request with deep sincerity that they dwell in the world for a long time

78
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
to bring benefits and bliss to every being.

79
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I request the Buddha to remain in this world to teach us Dharma.

80
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Buddha cannot wash away our sins or take away our suffering.

81
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What he can do is only to teach us the Dharma,

82
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
so we can change ourselves.

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So we want to request our own Buddha to remain in this world

84
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
by being awakened, understanding emptiness and our true suchness.

85
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Number eight, to always follow the teachings of Buddha.

86
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
All future teachers of God and men whose aspirations and vows have been completed,

87
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I will follow and study throughout the three periods of time

88
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and quickly attain great Bodhi.

89
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Follow Buddha's teaching

90
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
by always listening to the Dharma.

91
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
We want to learn the Dharma and to teach others.

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
To teach others doesn't mean you have to be on a podium.

93
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It means that in your daily activity,

94
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
you are compassionate and wise.

95
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
People can learn from you.

96
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Then you're leading by example.

97
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Number nine, to always be in harmony with all beings.

98
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I vow that every being in all directions will be peaceful, happy and without worry.

99
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
May they obtain the proper Dharma's profound aid

100
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
and may all their sufferings

101
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
be wiped away without exception.

102
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
We want all sentient beings to be happy.

103
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The only way is to learn the Dharma.

104
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
In order for them to learn the Dharma,

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
we must be in harmony with them,

106
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
accord with them.

107
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So the importance of courtesy, forbearance and tolerance is a must.

108
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That's the only way to eliminate all the disasters in the world.

109
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So take on social roles to benefit others

110
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
and to find ways to facilitate harmony in the world.

111
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Number ten, to dedicate all merits.

112
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The supreme and endless blessing

113
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
from Samatha Bhattra's conduct

114
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I now universally transfer.

115
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
May every living being drowning in the drip

116
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
soon return to the land of limitless light.

117
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
A bodhisattva accrues merits by his vows,

118
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
insight and compassion to all living beings.

119
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
He does not cultivate for himself.

120
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
He's cultivating for everyone

121
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
to rescue all sentient beings

122
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
out of the ocean of suffering.

123
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Therefore, when we practice these ten great vows,

124
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
we are being a bodhisattva.

125
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
This is all inherent in our nature.

126
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So we are originally a Samatha Bhattra bodhisattva,

127
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
so we understand who we really are.

128
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Lastly, the Huayan School of Buddhism

129
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
teaches about the sixfold attributes

130
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
to learn about the ten great vows.

131
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Number one is generality.

132
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
These ten in general

133
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
is called the ten great vows as a whole.

134
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Number two in general,

135
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
it has its particularity.

136
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
They are all different and unique.

137
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
For example, you can repent

138
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
about not being respectful,

139
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
or repent about not praising,

140
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
or repent about not making offerings.

141
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So repent and everyone else

142
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
is unique and different.

143
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Number three,

144
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
they all have their similarities.

145
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
For example,

146
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
respect and praise and make offering

147
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
is all about our devotion to Buddha.

148
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But number four,

149
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
they have their distinctions.

150
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
For example,

151
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
respect is with our body,

152
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
praising is with our mouth,

153
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
making offering is more with our heart.

154
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So they are all each unique and distinct.

155
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Number five is their formation

156
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
in terms of their function and usage.

157
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
These ten are the common cause

158
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
for Samatha Bhattra bodhisattva

159
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
to reach Buddhahood.

160
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
But they all have their own destruction.

161
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
They are individually different

162
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
and unhindered.

163
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
If you can use the sixfold attributes

164
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
to learn about the ten great vows,

165
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
you will be able to use them integratively.

166
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Samatha Bhattra Bodhisattva, he says,

167
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
if anyone devotedly practices

168
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
the ten great vows,

169
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I will immediately mount on the six-toothed elephant

170
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
and to see the person.

171
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I will secretly rub his head,

172
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
protect and comfort him,

173
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
so he will be able to accomplish

174
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
the ten great vows in his practice.

175
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
We can use this in our daily activities,

176
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
even amidst of difficulties

177
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
in our family or workplace,

178
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
we will still be able to activate

179
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
our awakened nature

180
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
and be a bodhisattva.

181
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So that's the class for today.

182
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Thank you for listening.

183
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Amitabha.
