1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,240
Today we are going to talk about moments before death.

2
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:25,240
Everyone has to face death eventually, so the question is how do we prepare for death?

3
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:33,240
We will use the verses from the Practices and Vows of Universal Worthy Bodhisattva to understand death.

4
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:41,240
As one is dying at the last moment, first we have to realize that no one can escape death.

5
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:48,240
In the Dharma Pada Sutra, Buddha tells a story about four brothers with supernatural powers

6
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,740
who knew their demise was coming in seven days, so each tried to escape.

7
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:58,240
The first brother hid himself under the sea, so death cannot find him.

8
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,240
The second brother hid himself in the highest mountain.

9
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,740
The third brother went up into the sky and hid in the clouds.

10
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:11,740
The fourth brother blended himself in the bustling street markets.

11
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:17,740
After seven days, all four of them still died, so death is inevitable.

12
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,240
In Buddhism, we meditate on death.

13
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,740
There are three steps to this death.

14
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:24,740
Meditation.

15
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:29,240
One is to think that we will die for sure.

16
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,740
In your mind's eye, visualize the people that you knew who are already dead.

17
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,740
Think of the people who are alive right now.

18
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,240
They will die one day.

19
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,240
Then think of yourself disappearing from the earth.

20
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,740
That day will happen.

21
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,740
So that's the first step.

22
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,240
The second step is to know death.

23
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,740
Death can come anytime.

24
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:02,740
You can die when you're very young or you can die when you're 100.

25
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,740
It can happen anytime.

26
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,740
Every breath can be our last breath.

27
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:13,740
We have to cherish every moment that we're living right now.

28
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,740
Every moment we should live fully.

29
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:22,740
Number three, when I'm dying, nothing can help me except the Dharma.

30
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:28,740
Only my understanding of the Dharma can stay with me when I'm dying.

31
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:33,740
Especially for Pure Land Buddhism, I believe in Amitabha Buddha.

32
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,740
Take refuge in his name and in him.

33
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:44,740
You end this meditation with a few recitations of the name Amitabha.

34
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,740
And then you finish up this death meditation.

35
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,740
Don't be afraid of the death meditation.

36
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:58,740
If you do this every day, you will have profound liberating insight into impermanence.

37
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,740
When you really understand impermanence

38
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:07,740
and understand that all conditional existence are elusive in nature,

39
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,740
you'll no longer be attached to anything,

40
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:17,740
that's actually nirvana or we call the state of no birth and no death.

41
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,740
What happens when we pass away?

42
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:24,740
At the last moment when all one's faculties scatter and decay.

43
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,740
This is talking about our body.

44
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,740
This body is like a machine.

45
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,740
Now it's shutting down.

46
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:35,740
We don't want to be attached to this body that is temporary.

47
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:40,740
We should see our body like a traveler that's staying in a hotel.

48
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,740
Or we can see our body like a rental car.

49
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,740
We're just renting it for a few days.

50
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,740
This body is borrowed from us.

51
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,740
It's in a normal karmic condition.

52
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,740
It is impermanent.

53
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:57,740
To all the relatives, one has to leave behind.

54
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:03,740
All our relatives, including our parents, spouse, children, siblings and loved ones,

55
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,740
nobody can go with you when you pass.

56
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:11,740
The key is to cherish every moment that you spend with them.

57
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,740
Stop arguing about the trivial matters of life

58
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,740
because all of us are going to pass one day.

59
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:21,740
So we want to have no regrets toward anyone.

60
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:25,740
On the other hand, we also do not want to be attached to anyone.

61
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,740
It should be love without any attachment.

62
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,740
So we want to have no regrets and no attachment.

63
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,740
That is the middle way.

64
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,740
Number three, all powers and status are lost.

65
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,740
Everything that you have, your position, your power,

66
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,740
everything will be lost the moment that you die.

67
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,740
It talks about four subcategories.

68
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,740
One, one's prime ministers and officials.

69
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,740
As if we are a king of a country.

70
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,740
All the people that are working for you, they will no longer be with you.

71
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,740
Two is your inner palaces and outer cities.

72
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,740
That's like your land, your house, your properties.

73
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,740
Three, elephants, horses and cars.

74
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,740
Your favorite car, your favorite vehicle will no longer be yours.

75
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,740
Number four, precious jewels and hidden treasures.

76
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,740
All your jewelries and money will no longer matter anymore.

77
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:26,740
So in conclusion, all can no longer accompany one.

78
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,740
Nothing can accompany you.

79
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:35,740
In the Yokakara Bomi Shastra, it talks about three improper meditative reflections.

80
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:39,740
One is reflection on never dying.

81
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,740
This is like the first one.

82
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,740
We think our body is going to live on forever.

83
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,740
That's why when we're meditating,

84
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,740
we cannot concentrate.

85
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,740
Number two, reflection on our relatives.

86
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,740
We are always thinking about how our relatives are doing,

87
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,740
their happiness and sorrow.

88
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,740
That's why we cannot concentrate when we're meditating.

89
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,740
Number three is reflection on our country.

90
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,740
It's like the third one.

91
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,740
We're always thinking about what's going on in this country,

92
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,740
our possessions.

93
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,740
That's why we cannot concentrate when we meditate.

94
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,740
So all these improper meditative reflections,

95
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,740
they will also come up when we're dying.

96
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,740
They will become karmic obstacles.

97
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,740
They will hinder our rebirth to the pure land.

98
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,740
So what will actually help us?

99
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:31,740
Only one's vows will not forsake and leave one.

100
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:36,740
The only thing that will help you is your bodhi resolve,

101
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,740
your bodhisattva vows.

102
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,740
That's the only thing you can take with you

103
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,740
because that's the most wholesome,

104
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,740
most virtuous thought you can have.

105
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,740
This is actually talking about the ten great aspirations

106
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,740
of universal, worthy bodhisattva.

107
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,740
Number one is to pay respect to all Buddhas.

108
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,740
Everyone is a Buddha.

109
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,740
We need to love and respect everyone.

110
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,740
That's the first vow.

111
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:06,740
Number two is to praise the Tathagata.

112
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,740
Use your mouth to praise all the people

113
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,740
who are going to be Buddha,

114
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,740
all their good qualities and all their virtues.

115
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,740
Number three is to pray.

116
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,740
To make abundant offerings.

117
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,740
We want to be as giving as we can.

118
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,740
Number four, repent all our sins.

119
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,740
Change all our bad ways into wholesome conduct.

120
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,740
Number five is to rejoice in other people's merits.

121
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,740
We don't want to be jealous of anyone.

122
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,740
We want to be a real bodhisattva

123
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,740
that's without jealousy or envy.

124
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,740
Number six, request the turning of the Dharma wheel.

125
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,740
Right now you're listening to Dharma.

126
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,740
God is requesting the turning of the Dharma wheel.

127
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,740
Number seven is to request the Buddha

128
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,740
to remain in this world.

129
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,740
You are the Buddha,

130
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,740
so you want yourself to be with the Dharma.

131
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:01,740
Then you are a Buddha living in the world.

132
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,740
Number eight is to follow Buddha's teaching all the time.

133
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,740
Always learning the Buddha's teaching

134
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,740
and always have the Dharma in our hearts.

135
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,740
Number nine is to constantly accord

136
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,740
with all sentient beings.

137
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,740
We want to be in harmony with everybody in our lives.

138
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,740
Number ten is to dedicate all our merits

139
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,740
to all sentient beings.

140
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,740
We love and we give all our merits

141
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,740
to everyone that is in our life

142
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,740
and to everyone in this world.

143
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,740
So that's the ten great aspirations

144
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,740
of a real bodhisattva.

145
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,740
If you can do this all your life

146
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,740
at the moment of your death,

147
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,740
that's the only thing on your mind,

148
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,740
then you'll definitely go to the Western world.

149
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,740
Go to the Western Pure Land.

150
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,740
At all times,

151
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,740
the vows will guide one forward

152
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,740
and in an instant,

153
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,740
one will be reborn

154
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,740
in the land of ultimate bliss.

155
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,740
All your vows,

156
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,740
they will guide you forward

157
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,740
when you're dying.

158
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,740
And in one instant,

159
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,740
you will be in the Western Pure Land.

160
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,740
But you will ask,

161
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,740
the Western Pure Land

162
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,740
is 100 billion Buddha lands away.

163
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,740
How can we get there in an instant?

164
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,740
It's because

165
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,740
everything is happening in our mind.

166
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,740
That's why in one instant,

167
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,740
you will be there

168
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,740
in the land of ultimate bliss

169
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,740
where there is no more birth

170
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,740
and no more death.

171
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,740
Pure Land Buddhism is about

172
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,740
faith, vows and practice.

173
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,740
What is this vow?

174
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,740
This vow is actually

175
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,740
the Bodhi resolve,

176
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,740
the ten great aspirations

177
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,740
of universal worthy bodhisattva.

178
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,740
So going to the Pure Land,

179
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,740
it's not just

180
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,740
we want to go to the Pure Land.

181
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,740
It's going to the Pure Land

182
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,740
to complete our bodhisattva path.

183
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,740
Our Bodhi resolve is our anchor

184
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,740
at the brink of our death.

185
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,740
That's how we connect with Amitabha Buddha.

186
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,740
Lastly, I want to share

187
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,740
about the Infinite Life Sutra.

188
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,740
Amitabha was a king.

189
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,740
He left his kingdom to become a monk.

190
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,740
His name was Dhammakara.

191
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,740
At that time,

192
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,740
there was a Buddha.

193
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,740
His name is

194
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,740
Lokavara Raja.

195
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,740
He said,

196
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,740
If one scoops water out of the ocean

197
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,740
with the cup,

198
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,740
he will reach the bottom

199
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,740
after many kalpas.

200
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,740
Likewise,

201
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,740
if one sincerely,

202
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,740
diligently and unceasingly

203
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,740
seeks the way,

204
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,740
he will be able to reach his destiny.

205
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,740
So what vow is there

206
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,740
that cannot be fulfilled?

207
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,740
If one uses a cup to scoop water

208
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,740
out of the ocean,

209
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,740
will he be able to

210
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,740
scoop it all?

211
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,740
Yes, he will.

212
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,740
Because of his perseverance

213
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,740
and Bodhi resolve,

214
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,740
you can accomplish anything.

215
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,740
That's when Dhammakara

216
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,740
officially made the 48 vows

217
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,740
and created the Pure Land.

218
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,740
So we want to have the same mind,

219
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,740
same spirit as Amitabha Buddha.

220
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,740
That's how you will be reborn

221
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,740
in his Pure Land.

222
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,740
So Pure Land Buddhism

223
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,740
is not just about chanting

224
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,740
the Buddha's name.

225
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,740
It is about bringing forth

226
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,740
your real Bodhi resolve.

227
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,740
You really want to become a Buddha

228
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,740
to save all sentient beings.

229
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,740
And you want to be enlightened.

230
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,740
When one obtains enlightenment,

231
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,740
one will realize

232
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,740
there's actually no birth

233
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,740
and no death.

234
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,740
Because our true nature

235
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,740
is the nature of no birth

236
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,740
and no death.

237
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,740
That's originally Nirvana.

238
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,740
That's the class for today.

239
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,740
Thank you for listening.

240
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,740
Amitabha.
