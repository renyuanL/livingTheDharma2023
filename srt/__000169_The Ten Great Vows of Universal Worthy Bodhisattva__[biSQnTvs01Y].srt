1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Today we are going to talk about the Ten Great Vows of Universal Worthy Bodhisattva.

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What's a Bodhisattva?

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's someone trying to become a Buddha, doing the work like a Buddha to help everybody be out of the reincarnation and become Buddha.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So they're full of love and compassion.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Universal Worthy Bodhisattva, he is the symbol of all Bodhisattva.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
His mind is broad, full of compassion, love, and is never-ending.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So we're going to learn his Ten Big Vows.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
This is what he lives by every day.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Today we're just going to cover four, and we're going to have two more classes to cover the other six.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The first vow is to pay respect to all Buddhas.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So respect and really treasure everybody.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So who is Buddha?

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Sometimes we bow to Buddha.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Who are we bowing to?

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We're not bowing to a statue.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We're bowing to our own Buddha nature.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Bowing is to show our respect to our own Buddha nature.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We want to respect everyone.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Everyone is a Buddha.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
That includes your husband, your wife, your children, everybody around you.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Everybody is a Buddha.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Respect everybody, regardless of who they are.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
In the Lotus Sutra, there is a never-despising Bodhisattva.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
He doesn't stay in the temple and chant.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
He goes everywhere.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And everybody he sees, he says to them,

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I deeply respect you.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I dare not belittle you because I know you are going to be a Buddha.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So he goes around and tells it to everybody without discrimination.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
All the monks and a lot of people, they started disliking him, thinking he's very annoying.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
They started throwing rocks and sticks at him because he goes around every day to tell people that.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And people started hating him.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But he never gets upset.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
He just still says the same thing.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You know, I dare not belittle you.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I respect you.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You are going to be a Buddha.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He does that all his life.

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Till his dying days, he heard this voice in the air.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You are going to reach Buddhahood because of what you did this lifetime.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And he became enlightened.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
All the people that hated him before started learning from him.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
He helped everybody reach Buddhahood and become enlightened.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
This is a great story of someone who,

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
truly respects everybody equally without any discrimination.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So this is what we want to learn, the Bodhisattva's way.

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And the second is to praise the Tathagata.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We love and respect everybody and we also use our mouth to praise people.

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Buddha's other name is called Tathagata.

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Why do we put this word here?

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Because you want to praise the virtues and goodness of Buddha.

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Everybody is a Buddha.

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But not everybody is virtuous.

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
We only praise the good virtues.

55
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
If someone is killing people, we do not go praise them.

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You want to praise everybody that's doing good,

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
that's being virtuous, that's doing kind deeds.

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
We don't want to be stingy with our praises.

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Every day you should praise someone.

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Praise your husband.

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Praise your wife.

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Praise your mom.

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Praise your kids.

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Praise everybody.

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
When you praise them, they have more confidence.

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
They will be encouraged.

67
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
They do things better.

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So there is a story.

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
There is a cow.

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
In the olden days, the cows, they can talk.

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So one day he told his farmer, his owner,

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Owner, you are so poor.

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I have an idea.

74
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You go tell the rich farmer I'm going to have a race with his cow.

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And whoever wins the race will get a thousand dollars and you'll be rich.

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So he said, oh, sure.

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So all the villagers, they come to see this race.

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The poor farmer said to everybody, oh, this is my cow.

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
He's great.

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
He runs very fast and he works really hard.

81
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But he only has one horn.

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Then they start having a race.

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But the cow lost.

84
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The owner asked him, you told me to go have a race and you lost.

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What's going on?

86
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
He said, I was going to win.

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
But you said I only have one horn.

88
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And made me lose my confidence.

89
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
That's why I lost.

90
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Okay, you go tell him I'm going to have another race.

91
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
This time you only say my good quality.

92
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Don't say my shortcomings.

93
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And I will win.

94
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So all the villagers come and they have another race.

95
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And he said, oh, my cow is wonderful.

96
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So fast and so hardworking.

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
He's such a great cow.

98
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And then they have a race.

99
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And short enough, he won.

100
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So everybody needs praise.

101
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Their confidence will boost up and they will do great in their life.

102
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So don't be stingy with your praises.

103
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You know, that's a very good deed when you praise others.

104
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The third great vow is to make abundant offerings.

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Offerings.

106
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
That means we give other people gifts.

107
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Do everything that you can to give to others.

108
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
As Buddhas, we do a lot of offerings to the Buddha.

109
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Every morning, we will give Buddha a little cup of water.

110
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Why do we do that?

111
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Buddhas don't need your offerings.

112
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
These offerings is to help us remember to cultivate.

113
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Today, I'm going to have a pure heart.

114
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
My heart is going to be as pure as this water.

115
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So I offer it to Buddha to remind myself I'm going to be pure.

116
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We offer Buddha flowers.

117
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Why do we offer him flowers?

118
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Because flowers are causes.

119
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Virtuous causes will give you good results.

120
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So flower is the cause and we offer fruits.

121
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Fruits is the result.

122
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Do good deeds, you will have good results.

123
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You have prosperous life.

124
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You will have very good life if you are a good person.

125
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So all the flowers, all the fruits, that is just to remind yourself to be good.

126
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And we offer Buddha lights.

127
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It means wisdom.

128
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Today, I'm going to be wise.

129
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm not going to fight with anyone.

130
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm going to love everybody because I know I'm one with the universe, with everybody.

131
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
All the offerings is to help yourself learn, improve and be a Bodhisattva.

132
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
All the offerings is just to bring out our loving heart.

133
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,000
2600 years ago in India, Shakyamuni Buddha, he's the only Buddha we know of on this earth.

134
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
There was a very, very poor lady.

135
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
She really, really wants to offer a light to Buddha.

136
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
She goes to beg and finally got one penny.

137
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And she went to get the oil lamp.

138
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
She's so happy.

139
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
She went up to Buddha and said,

140
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Buddha, I want to offer this lamp to you.

141
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
With this, I vow that I want to be wise.

142
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I want to reach Buddhahood.

143
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And I want to help all sentient beings to get out of delusions, darkness and reach enlightenment and Buddhahood.

144
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And she bowed and that was her offering.

145
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So the next day,

146
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
everybody offered a lot of lights to Buddha.

147
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But all the lights were out, except hers.

148
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Buddha's servant tried to blow out the oil lamp.

149
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
But for the life of her, he could not blow it out.

150
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It would just keep going, keep going, keep going.

151
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And Buddha says, because her heart was so sincere,

152
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
her light will be strong forever, forever.

153
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And she will reach Buddhahood.

154
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
If your heart is strong and you really want to become a Bodhisattva,

155
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
and help everybody become enlightened,

156
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
that is a strong vow.

157
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
A strong vow will have great power.

158
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And that is the power that gives you life force.

159
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So to make abundant offerings,

160
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
that's a Bodhisattva's way.

161
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Lastly is to repent and confess.

162
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You might say, I haven't done anything bad in my lifetime.

163
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I've been pretty good.

164
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
In Buddhism, we say every thought creates a karma, a result.

165
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So you thought.

166
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
This person is ugly.

167
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
That has karma.

168
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Someone in your life will come to you and say you're ugly.

169
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Because you created this thought.

170
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Every thought is a karma.

171
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So how much bad thoughts we have, it's countless.

172
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So every day we must confess.

173
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Confess our sins and repent.

174
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
What do we mean by repent?

175
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Not just to bow to Buddha.

176
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Repenting means I will never do it again.

177
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I will be good.

178
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I will not be mad at anyone.

179
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I will never yell at anyone.

180
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I will be kind.

181
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I will be loving.

182
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Confess.

183
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You will become better.

184
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Through confession, you will be clean and you start over.

185
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You keep learning.

186
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You keep starting over.

187
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You do bad things.

188
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You keep confessing.

189
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And you keep getting better.

190
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So always confess our sins.

191
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
There was a boy.

192
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Ever since he was little,

193
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
he just remembered he was brought into the orphanage by his mom.

194
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That was the last thing he remembered of his mom.

195
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And he never seen his mom again.

196
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So he grew up.

197
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So he grew up in the orphanage hating his mom.

198
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So his whole life, he's full of hate.

199
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
He grew up.

200
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And he's in his 30s.

201
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
One day he finally found the courage.

202
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
He said, I'm going to go try to look for my mom.

203
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So one day he finally found where she stayed and went to the place.

204
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
She was already dead.

205
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And she had this table and this desk.

206
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And he looked in her drawer.

207
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And what did he find?

208
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
He found all the train ticket stops from her.

209
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
From her house to the orphanage.

210
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's full of it.

211
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The whole drawer is full of the ticket stops.

212
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
What does that mean?

213
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
His mom visited him every day.

214
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
She was there every day to see him.

215
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
She just didn't let him know.

216
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
He cried.

217
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
He knew I was wrong my whole life.

218
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
My mom loves me.

219
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So from that day on, he changed.

220
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And his life is full of love.

221
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
He never hates anyone anymore.

222
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
All the bad things that happen to us is not caused by others.

223
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's caused by our own thinking.

224
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So change your thought to be one that's loving and full of appreciation and kindness.

225
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Then you change your life.

226
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Repent.

227
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
That's when we grow and become a better person.

228
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
These are all great vows.

229
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,000
If we do this every day, we become the universal, worthy Bodhisattva.

230
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
His vow never ends.

231
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And it's from thought to thought.

232
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Not even a single thought, he forgets about his vows.

233
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
His body, mind, and speech all take the action to do this vow.

234
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And he never ceases.

235
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And he never feels tired.

236
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Every waking moment, he is trying to be a Bodhisattva.

237
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And that's why we try to learn.

238
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
To become a great person with great vision inside of our heart.

239
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
To love to help everybody become enlightened.

240
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Okay, so that's the class for today.

241
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And we will continue with the vows.

242
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Next time.

243
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Thank you for listening.
