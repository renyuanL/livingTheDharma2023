00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Today's topic is the Shravagama Sutra.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Buddha spoke the sutras to cause living beings to go back to the origin and to return to the source.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
In other words, to turn our backs on the mundane life and to unite with enlightenment.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Shravagama Sutra is known as the Sutra for Enlightenment.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Today we will share a beautiful verse from the Sutra, hopefully to bring forth great wisdom.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Ananda, you have not yet understood that all the defiling objects that appear,

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
all the illusory, ephemeral characteristics spring up in the very spot

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
where they also come to an end.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Ananda is a main character of the Sutra.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Once collecting alms, he was under the spell of the daughter of a mantamji.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
As a monk for twelve years, he almost lost the sexual misconduct precept.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Why did this happen to him? Because he did not understand the truth.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The truth is that all is illusory and ephemeral.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Our attraction between men and women is only an illusion of the mind.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It is short-lived and it is impermanent.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Ananda did not see. He was still under the influence of the spell.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We need to see clearly the truth, where all the phenomena or delusions come from.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It springs up from the very spot where they also come to an end,

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
which means they come from nowhere and they go to nowhere.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The very spot is emptiness.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,000
In the Tantide Buddhism, we use the three meditations to understand our one true mind.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The three meditations are Void Meditation, Unreal Meditation, and Ming Meditation.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Void Meditation means understanding the true essence of all phenomena is emptiness.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Unreal Meditation means to understand that everything

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
has conventional existence.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You cannot say they do not exist, but it's unreal existence.

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So it's all because of cause and condition that they arise and cease.

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Number three is the Ming Meditation, or one true mind, the middle way.

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
This whole sutra is talking about one mind in terms of the three meditations.

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The first section is about Void Meditation.

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:55,000
All the phenomena only comes up at the very spot, which is emptiness.

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
In this sutra, it talks about a practitioner.

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
He's known as a pure youth adorned with fragrance.

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
His specialty is his sense of smell.

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
One time, they were lighting up incense.

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
He said, I contemplated this fragrance.

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It did not come from the wood.

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It did not come from emptiness.

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It did not come from the smoke.

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It did not come from the fire.

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
There's no place it came from, and there's no place it went to.

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Because of this, my discriminating mind dispelled, and I attained the absence of outflow.

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So this practitioner, he was able to become enlightened through the sense of smell.

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Through this fragrance, he understands it's coming from nowhere.

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's not the wood.

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's not the empty sky.

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's not the fire or the smoke.

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It comes from nowhere, and it goes nowhere.

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's emptiness.

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It has no more outflow.

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
That means no more afflictions.

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We can learn how to be enlightened and understand emptiness.

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
For example, if someone insulted us, we became angry.

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Where does this anger come from?

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
We have to contemplate.

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It comes from nowhere, and it goes nowhere.

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Did it come from this person's words?

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
If it came from this person's words, then everybody should be upset when they hear it.

59
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
But only I'm upset.

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
That means it has no real existence.

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Is it coming from myself?

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
If it's coming from myself, then I should be angry all the time.

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So it's not from myself either.

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So there's nowhere it came from.

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's true nature.

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's emptiness.

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That way, we can let go of this anger because this anger is not me.

68
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I am the emptiness, which is our true nature, our true enlightened mind.

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Now let's look at the second line.

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
They are what is called illusory falseness.

71
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
This is talking about the unreal meditation.

72
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
They do look like they exist.

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Just like the shadow, you can see the shadow.

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
But do they really exist?

75
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's only a shadow.

76
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Like a magician pulling a rabbit out of the hat.

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Just like a hand.

78
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So is it real?

79
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's an illusion.

80
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So it exists.

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It has conventional existence.

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But it's only from karma, from cause and effect that everything springs up.

83
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
But it's all emptiness.

84
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So understand the unreal nature of their existence.

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But their nature is in truth the bright substance of wonderful enlightenment.

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
We understand emptiness.

87
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
We understand their conventional existence as illusory falseness.

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Then we will understand everything's true nature is the bright substance of wonderful enlightenment.

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Our one true mind.

90
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So we should use this illusory life right now to match with our nature.

91
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's called the Dharma nature.

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Every urge.

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Every thought.

94
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Every action should accord with the Dharma nature.

95
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Then our great wisdom will emerge and afflictions will cease.

96
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Now we explain it further.

97
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Thus it is throughout up to the five skandhas, six entrances to the twelve places and the eighteen realms,

98
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:38,000
the union and mixture of various causes and conditions account for their illusory and false existence.

99
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And the separation and dispersion of the causes and conditions results in their illusory and false extinction.

100
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The first part is void meditation.

101
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The second part is unreal meditation.

102
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Again, we call our body and mind the five skandhas of form, feelings, perception, mental formation and consciousness.

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That consists our body and mind.

104
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
We think that's us.

105
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
That's the self.

106
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But Buddha says its true nature is voidness.

107
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's not a real existence.

108
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
We should not think there is a self that's separated from others.

109
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
We separate ourselves from others because of this body.

110
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
But this is an illusion.

111
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
We are all together as one phenomenon.

112
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
But when we see others, we might put up an image.

113
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Because we want to impress others or want others to like us.

114
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
We might be fake nice.

115
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
But we're not being the genuine self.

116
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
We're all living in the illusory life of our alaya consciousness.

117
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:00,000
To understand this, we'll be able to really love and be genuine to all beings and treat everyone like ourselves.

118
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The five skandhas, if you open it up,

119
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:14,000
is the six entrances of our six sense organs of eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body and mind.

120
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:24,000
If you add the six sense objects of sight, sound, smell, taste, touch and dharma,

121
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
then it becomes the twelve places.

122
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
If you add the six consciousness of eye consciousness, ear consciousness,

123
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
nose consciousness, tongue, body and mind,

124
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
then it becomes the eighteen realms.

125
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
The five skandhas, you expand it,

126
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
it becomes the eighteen realms.

127
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
That's our body and mind.

128
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
How does it come about to be phenomenon?

129
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's all because of the union and mixture of cause and condition that it exists.

130
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It has illusory and false existence.

131
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And it's the separation and dispersion of the causation that results in their extinction.

132
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
All the arising and ceasing, life and death,

133
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
it's only cause and conditions we call karma.

134
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
This karma is what's carrying us throughout lifetime, after lifetime.

135
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
In the sutra, it says,

136
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
karma, it accords with living beings' minds

137
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
in response to their capacity to know.

138
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Karma is from our own laya consciousness.

139
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It stores all our past karmic deeds.

140
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Right now, we're just experiencing the retribution of our past karmic actions.

141
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So our five skandhas up to the eighteen realms

142
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
is all based on our past karmic deeds.

143
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So, for example, there are five members in the family.

144
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Four might feel they're very happy.

145
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And love.

146
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And one might feel like it's misery.

147
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So it's all based on our karma.

148
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
If we keep ceasing upon conditions,

149
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
that means grabbing onto the external objects,

150
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
the five skandhas, they're all hindrances.

151
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
But if we go inward and contemplate on their true nature,

152
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
the five skandhas and the eighteen realms,

153
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
they're helping us to become enlightened.

154
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
In the sutra, it talks about two dharma principles.

155
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Dharma princes named physician kings and superior physicians.

156
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
They became enlightened through the sensory object of the taste.

157
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
From the twelve places, they said,

158
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
the nature of flavor is not empty and non-existent,

159
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
nor is it the body and mind,

160
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
nor is it apart from the body and mind.

161
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
We became enlightened by discriminating among flavors.

162
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:05,000
The flavor is not empty because it has unreal existence.

163
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And it's non-existent because it's voidness.

164
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It's not the body and mind.

165
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's not the five skandhas.

166
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's not the twelve places.

167
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
But it's not apart from the body and mind.

168
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So that's how they become enlightened.

169
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Through tasting.

170
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The nature of food and tasting

171
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
is the bright substance of wonderful enlightenment,

172
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
our one true mind.

173
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Who would have thought that the production,

174
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
extinction, coming and going

175
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
are fundamentally the everlasting wonderful light

176
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
of the treasury of the Thus Come One,

177
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
the unmoving, all-pervading perfection

178
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
and wonderful nature of true suchness.

179
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
So going back to the Ming meditation,

180
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
all the production, extinction,

181
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
coming and going,

182
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
that's talking about all the cause and conditions.

183
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
They are fundamentally the one true Buddha nature.

184
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Here it describes four great qualities of our pure mind.

185
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's everlasting,

186
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
which means it doesn't have coming and going.

187
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And it's a wonderful light of the treasury of the Thus Come One,

188
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
which means they have no confusion or enlightenment.

189
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And it's unmoving,

190
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
which means it has no production or extinction.

191
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And it's all-pervading.

192
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's nowhere, but it's everywhere.

193
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
That's the excellent qualities of our one true mind.

194
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
We call it the true suchness.

195
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
So own up to who you really are.

196
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You are not this little bubble,

197
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
the five skandhas.

198
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
We are a big ocean that has infinite potentials.

199
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So contemplate the fundamental falseness of appearances

200
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
and contemplate on the fundamental truth of the nature.

201
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
All appearances are illusory

202
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
and the real nature is our one true mind.

203
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
If within the true and permanent nature

204
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
one sees coming and going,

205
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
confusion and enlightenment,

206
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
or birth and death,

207
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
there is nothing that can be obtained.

208
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Lastly, we go back to the void meditation.

209
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Within this true nature,

210
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
there is no coming or going,

211
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
confusion or enlightenment,

212
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
birth or death.

213
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
There is nothing.

214
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Emptiness is our true suchness.

215
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
In the Sutra, it talks about a practitioner named Bhattapala.

216
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
He became enlightened through the sensory object of touch.

217
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
One day, he was taking a shower.

218
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
He became enlightened.

219
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Suddenly, I awakened to the fact

220
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
that the water does not wash away the dust,

221
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
nor does it cleanse the body.

222
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
At that point, between the two, I became peaceful.

223
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I attained the state of there being nothing at all.

224
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
There is no water.

225
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
There is no dirt.

226
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
There is no body.

227
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
He realized that all of these are conditioned existence

228
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
and they are all empty in nature.

229
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
So there is absolutely nothing at all.

230
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
That's our true suchness.

231
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
The reason we chant Amitabha

232
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
is to help us become awakened

233
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
to our true nature,

234
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
the bright substance of wonderful enlightenment.

235
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Every day, in all situations,

236
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
we can meditate on void,

237
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
on real and the mean meditation.

238
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And by chanting Amitabha,

239
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
that's how we be mindful of our true nature.

240
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
So that's the class for today.

241
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Thank you for listening.

242
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Amitabha.

243
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
