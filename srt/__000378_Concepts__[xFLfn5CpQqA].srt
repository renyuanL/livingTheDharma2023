1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,320
Today we are going to talk about concepts.

2
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,040
We always say we need to let go.

3
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,040
Let go of what?

4
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:26,080
We are going to talk about 24 concepts that we should let go.

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,160
The first one is Attainment.

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:36,160
Attainment is when we gain something from nothing, such as fame, fortune, power.

7
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,160
We think the more we have, the better we are.

8
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,620
This is out of our greed.

9
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:48,040
We think there is something to attain, but little do we know, a lot of times misfortune

10
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,040
is blessing in disguise.

11
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,460
There is a wise old man with a beautiful stallion.

12
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,960
He loves this horse.

13
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,820
One day the horse disappeared.

14
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,280
Everybody came to comfort him about his loss.

15
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,060
He said this might not be a bad thing.

16
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:13,100
Sure enough, a few days later, the horse came back, brought another beautiful horse.

17
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,920
Everybody came and congratulated him.

18
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,720
He said this probably is not a good thing.

19
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,760
His son loved this new horse, rode it every day.

20
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,160
One day he fell off the horse and broke his leg.

21
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:36,000
Everybody came to comfort him about his son's misfortune, but the old man said this might

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,420
not be a bad thing.

23
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:43,200
Sure enough, the government was drafting for people to go to war.

24
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,700
Because his son broke his leg, he didn't have to go.

25
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,780
A lot of people died in that war.

26
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:53,420
A lot of times misfortune are blessing in disguise.

27
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,620
Whether it's attainment or not.

28
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,620
It's a blessing in disguise.

29
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:11,620
It's not necessarily just

30
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:21,280
a blessing or actually a photosynthesis.

31
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,900
The main thing was forgiveness.

32
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,900
It's Dasana.

33
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,020
Desana.

34
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:25,180
It was Changlin.

35
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:25,320
ls

36
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:32,380
this life that we want. That's why we keep living and it will take us into many lifetimes

37
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:39,140
of reincarnation because we have this strong attachment to this allied consciousness, the

38
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:46,900
deluded mind. Because of this attachment to this life faculty, we are continuously in

39
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:55,580
reincarnation. One and two are a group because it's based on greed. Number three and four

40
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:04,420
are a group. Number three is generic similarities. Number four is the similarity. Number three

41
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:11,460
generic similarity is when we are in a group that are similar. For example, dogs, they're

42
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:17,920
all dogs because they're similar. Arhats are saints that have relinquished the idea of

43
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:24,720
the self so they are similar. Bodhisattvas, they're all like-minded who want to save sentient

44
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,220
beings.

45
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:25,560
Subtitles by the Amara.org community

46
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:32,640
So they are called generic similarities. But there are dissimilarities within similarities.

47
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:39,620
For example, we are all human, but they are mundane and they are saints. Mundane are actually

48
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:47,900
called people with dissimilarities. We all have very dissimilar afflictions and defilements.

49
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:55,220
But the saints, the more enlightened they are, the more similar they become. So the

50
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:59,000
people are actually called people with dissimilarities.

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:07,520
Number five, six, seven are based on samadhi. Number five is no thought samadhi. This samadhi

52
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:15,480
is cultivated by externalists. They go into deep meditation where their six consciousness

53
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:21,960
stop working. Therefore, they have no thoughts. They stop all thinking. They think that's

54
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,060
the way to liberation. But in fact, it's not. They think that's the way to liberation. But

55
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,060
in fact, it's not. They think that's the way to liberation. But in fact, it's not. They

56
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,060
think that's the way to liberation. But in fact, it's not. They think that's the way

57
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,240
to liberation. But in fact, it's not. It's a fourth samadhi. It's like you put a rock

58
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,040
on top of the grass, hoping it will never grow. But the root is still there. You're

59
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,500
just stopping thoughts.

60
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:46,540
Number six, samadhi of extinction. That's the samadhi of arhats. They also stop their

61
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:53,800
six consciousness from working. But they also stop all feelings. They have no feelings of

62
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,800
pain or pleasure.

63
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,100
They have no feelings of pain or pleasure. They have no thinking. They're different from

64
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:06,980
externalists in the fact that they use this to let go of the attachment to the self. So

65
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:14,280
they're more enlightened and their afflictions are eradicated based on the samadhi. But this

66
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:21,840
is still not the samadhi of buddhas. This is only a stage of the arhats. This is not

67
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,640
the ultimate samadhi either.

68
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,640
Number seven, samadhi of the past.

69
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,340
Number seven is reward of non-thought.

70
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:37,760
Number five, no-thought samadhi is the cause. Reward of no-thought, that's the effect. People

71
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:44,360
who practice the no-thought-samadhi, when they relinquish their body this lifetime,

72
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:51,460
they take rebirth in the heaven of no thought-in the fourth dhyana. That's when they reborn

73
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,480
in that heavenly realm. But that is still not the samadhi.

74
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,920
not a good place to take rebirth in because you will not be enlightened either. You just

75
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:05,440
have no thoughts for a long, long, long time. Last time we talked about there are five wrong

76
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:14,600
views. One is attachment to unbeneficial precepts and one is attachment to the wrong view. Number

77
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:21,860
five is attachment to unbeneficial precepts. This is the wrong cause of enlightenment.

78
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:27,760
You think practicing the samadhi, stopping thoughts would be enlightenment, but that's

79
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:33,780
the wrong cause. Taking rebirth in the heaven of no thought is attachment to wrong view,

80
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:41,080
the wrong effect. So cause and effect, they're both wrong. Externalists, they think that's

81
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:47,200
the way to enlightenment, but it's not. So all these are only concepts. There is actually

82
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,740
no samadhi to gain and there's no enlightenment to gain.

83
00:06:51,860 --> 00:07:00,980
After all, number eight, nine, ten, that's above our language. Number eight is body of

84
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:09,820
nouns. We give names to people, place, and things. For example, body, mind. These are

85
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:16,980
nouns. When you have more than one, it's called bodies. Then number nine, bodies of sentences.

86
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:21,180
You put the nouns into sentences. You make a phrase.

87
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:26,240
Body and mind are both impermanent. That's a sentence.

88
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,700
Then we have bodies of phonemes. These are words.

89
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:42,420
So number ten is the basis of nouns and sentences. All these are only concepts, human-made concepts.

90
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:50,080
We should not be attached to words, to nouns, to sentences. These are illusions. These three,

91
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,220
they can be in the form of words. These are illusions. These three, they can be in the

92
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:51,820
form of words. These are illusions. These three, they can be in the form of words. These

93
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,500
are illusions. These three, they can be in the form of words. These are illusions. These

94
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:57,200
are illusions. These three, they can be in the form of words. These three, they can be

95
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,180
in the form of words. These three, they can be in the form of words. These are illusions.

96
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:58,560
Let's start.

97
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:07,360
They come in contact with the six sense objects of sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, and

98
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,140
Darma. recycling and Notes

99
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:17,580
Language, they can be in three sense objects. In sight, when we see writings, or it can

100
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,560
be sound when we hear language. It can be...

101
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,700
Sitting

102
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,120
sitting

103
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,660
Nor

104
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:21,740
Seven

105
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:21,760
Sides

106
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:21,820
Three

107
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:29,120
or thoughts. It's called Dharma. That's the object of the mind. But if you want to

108
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:37,700
realize your true nature, you have to be away from these three sense objects. In the Awakening

109
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:47,540
of Faith in Mahayana by Asvangosha, he says, suchness transcends verbalization, description

110
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:55,100
and conceptualization. It's not what you hear in words. It's not what you see in writing.

111
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:01,780
It's not even the thoughts, the language in your mind. It should be away from all these

112
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:07,780
language for you to be really enlightened and see your true suchness.

113
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:16,660
11, 12, 13 and 14, there are four forms of rising and ceasing.

114
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,520
Everything is up and down. Everything is up and down. Everything is up and down. Everything

115
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:24,400
is up and down. All these conditions are rising. They have these four forms. Our body goes

116
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:34,020
through birth, aging, sickness and death. Every one of our thoughts. It goes through

117
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:43,400
rising, abiding, changing and ceasing. Every single one of our thoughts. And the whole

118
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,840
world comes into being, dwelling and ceasing.

119
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:56,180
decaying, and disappearing. Every condition arising, they go through these four stages.

120
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:04,800
So we should not be upset when we get old, when we get sick, or even when we die. Because

121
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:14,200
these are also illusions, concepts that we come up with. The whole reincarnation is only

122
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:25,540
happening in a dream. 15, 16, 17 is about karma, revolving, that's reincarnation. We're

123
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:32,680
always in this river of turning and flowing. We cannot get out of this strong current of

124
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:41,040
reincarnation. Lifetime after lifetimes, we want to turn around by getting out of reincarnation.

125
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,140
Number 16, distinction. That's talking about karma.

126
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:44,180
Number 16, distinction. That's talking about karma. Number 16, distinction. That's talking

127
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:51,680
about karma. Every karma has its definite effect. Wholesome thoughts will have good

128
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:59,640
retribution. Unwholesome thoughts will give you negative retribution. Karma is definite.

129
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:06,420
Cause and effect is always for sure. They cannot be mixed up, and they cannot make any

130
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:14,120
mistakes. That's why it's distinct and definite. Number 17 is interaction. Interaction

131
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,440
is always for sure. Cause and effect are always corresponding with each other. That's why

132
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,360
it's called interaction. Good cause will have good effect. Bad cause will have bad effect.

133
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,940
Greed, anger, ignorance will bring you to the three lower realms. If you are kind, compassionate,

134
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:38,880
you go to higher realms or go to the western pure land. It's all about your cause that

135
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,060
will have the corresponding effect or retribution. Number 18, distinction. That's talking about

136
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,440
karma. Grandy represents the opportunity, heaven represents the scandal, and nieders

137
00:11:46,440 --> 00:12:01,560
represent the

138
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:01,640
hoped.

139
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,260
The important thing is, your ancestors who always blowed the candles of karma believe

140
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,060
in you.

141
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,940
Being with God is life.

142
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:13,960
You might say, Even though the people of this world is very powerful, it's the same

143
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:13,980
because of the cause or effect.

144
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,000
Even though the people of this world are very powerful, it's because of the Cause

145
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:23,440
we have no time left number 19 is sequence everything must have order like you go to

146
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:30,360
first grade second grade you move up or when you cook you must wash your vegetables cut them and

147
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:36,660
then cook you cannot do it out of order or you cannot get anything done so things must have

148
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:44,840
sequence and order if you're cultivating first you take refuge in the buddha dharma sangha then

149
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:51,560
you take the five precepts and then the bodhisattva precept you cannot do it out of order but this

150
00:12:51,560 --> 00:13:04,960
order is also only a concept 20 21 and 22 they are a group 20 is about time time is marking of

151
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,480
intervals years

152
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:16,120
month days hours these are intervals of time this is only relative some people say you cannot chant

153
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:23,720
the sutra at night because you're gonna attract ghosts but these are all made up concepts time

154
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:30,680
is only relative and it's only happening on our earth the time elsewhere is totally different

155
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:36,100
21 is direction front back right left

156
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:36,640
north

157
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:46,780
south up and down these are man-made concept of direction location these are also relative because

158
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:53,740
we think it's important some people very into feng shui they think how you place thing is very

159
00:13:53,740 --> 00:14:05,940
important that's only human made concept 22 is numeration numbers also human made concept we are

160
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,640
very

161
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:14,920
attached to number money we want a lot of money oil price so expensive right now we are very attached

162
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:23,880
to the price the number in our medical report it's horrible we're very upset every day we are attached

163
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:31,220
to these numbers and our emotion goes up and down because of these numbers but do we know they're

164
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:36,620
phantasms made up by our mind so we should try to let go of our memory that's the great point is

165
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:41,620
of our attachment to time, direction, and numeration.

166
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:47,120
Lastly, 23 and 24, one is combination,

167
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,960
one is discontinuity.

168
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:54,080
Combination, it's about blending and uniting,

169
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:58,120
such as cause and effect, they are blending and uniting.

170
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,880
Water and milk, put them together, it becomes milk water.

171
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,780
So that's combination.

172
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,540
Some people believe in combination,

173
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,740
some people believe in discontinuity,

174
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,080
such as people might think there's no cause and effect.

175
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,780
Everything happens, it's created by a God.

176
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,540
That's spontaneity.

177
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:24,160
Our hats are caught up in combination of cause and effect.

178
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,900
Externalists, they are caught up in the spontaneity.

179
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:32,340
So both of these are not in alignment

180
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,980
with our enlightenment

181
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,220
and our true suchness.

182
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,280
You have to let go of both of these attachments

183
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,060
for you to be fully enlightened.

184
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:48,060
These 24 are human-made concepts that we live by.

185
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,680
But if you can see all these things,

186
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,320
there's not a me, there's not a real existence,

187
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,420
but human-made ideas.

188
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,100
That way you can truly let go,

189
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,400
and one day you will really see

190
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,280
the world as an enlightened person.

191
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,100
You will feel liberation in your own mind.

192
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,640
So that's the class for today.

193
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,980
Thank you for listening.

194
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,820
Amitabha.
