1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Today we are going to talk about Samadhi.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Samadhi means proper concentration or proper reception.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That means our mind is in total control.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We are the owner of our mind.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It is a state of absorption where our mind is brought into focus

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and our mind is true, righteous and proper without any deviance or bias

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and it is without any false thinking.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We are going to study the Sixth Patriarch Hui Nang Master's Platform Sutra

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
that talks about Samadhi.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
He says in order to have complete wisdom

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
you must understand the two kinds of Samadhi

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
the Samadhi of one form and Samadhi of one conduct.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Let's first look at the Samadhi of one form.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
If you do not dwell in forms anywhere

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and do not give rise to hate or love

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
do not grasp or reject

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and do not calculate advantage or disadvantage

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
protection and destruction while in the midst of forms

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
but instead remain tranquil, calm and yielding

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
then you will have achieved the Samadhi of one form.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Samadhi of one form is a wisdom

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
which means our mind do not dwell in any form.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
That means the living situation

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
all the phenomena

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
when you are not attached to form

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
you are back to your essence

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
which is formless without any attachment.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Anytime, anywhere

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
we are in complete control

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
in charge of our emotion.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
When situation comes

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
we do not give rise to love or hate

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and we do not grasp or reject

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
any kind of situation

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
things or people.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's not that we try to ignore anyone

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
but our mind should always be at peace

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
without these strong emotions

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and strong discriminations

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and we do not calculate advantages or disadvantages

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
do not be selfish

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
or have a strong form of the self

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
the Diamond Sutra

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
it says the Bodhisattva

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
should not dwell in any form when giving

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
when we give or help others

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
we do not think what is there for us

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
we do not remember the person that's giving

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
and the person that's receiving

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
and how much the offering is

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
so let go of all the attachment to form

52
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
that's when we would be at peace.

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
In the midst of any form

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
any living situation

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
we should remain tranquil, calm

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
and ill-being

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
so that's our natural state of mind

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
when we are in control

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
when we have the Samadhi

60
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
we will no longer be attached

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
to living situation

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
to your family, to your co-worker

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
to your friends, relatives

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
you still perform your duty

65
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
and do the best that you can

66
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
but you have no attachment

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
that's our proper state of mind

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
when it's at peace.

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You probably heard this story

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
there are two men arguing

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
about a flag flapping in the wind

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
one says it is the wind that is moving

73
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
the other says no

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
it is the flag that is moving

75
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
a Zen monk came and said

76
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
neither the flag or wind is moving

77
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
it is the mind that moves

78
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
so when our mind moves

79
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
or is agitated

80
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
and it's not calm

81
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
it is giving its power away

82
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
to the situation

83
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
we are no longer in control

84
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
we are no longer the owner

85
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
of our mind

86
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
so Samadhi means

87
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
we are always in charge of our mind

88
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
we can think the thought

89
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
that we want to think

90
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
we can have the emotion

91
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
the feeling that we want to have

92
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
we are always in charge of our mind

93
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
so Samadhi in one form is wisdom

94
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Samadhi of one conduct

95
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
is concentration

96
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
this is more understanding

97
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
the teaching of the Dharma

98
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
this is more about

99
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
the effectiveness

100
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
of your practice

101
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
now let's look at

102
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
the Samadhi of one conduct

103
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
in all places

104
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
whether walking, standing, sitting

105
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
or lying down

106
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
maintain a simple and straight mind

107
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
and attain the unmoving

108
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
bodhimata

109
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
and the true realization

110
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
of the pure land

111
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
this is called

112
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
the Samadhi of one conduct

113
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
in all life actions

114
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
walking, standing, sitting

115
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
or lying down

116
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
we should maintain

117
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
aware and mindful of our thought

118
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
our mind should be simple

119
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
and straightforward

120
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
the mind that is conniving

121
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
or pretending

122
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
or lying

123
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
that is not being straightforward

124
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
we should always have a pure mind

125
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
that is very sincere

126
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
our words, our appearance

127
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
and our heart should be the same

128
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
without any pretending

129
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
or putting on a mask

130
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
we should always be respectful

131
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
that is in alignment

132
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
with our true nature

133
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
and we want to attain

134
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
the unmoving bodhimata

135
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
that means our holy temple

136
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
the holy temple is not

137
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
in the other places

138
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
it is in our own mind

139
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
when our mind is at peace

140
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
that is the bodhimata

141
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
and it is the true realization

142
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
of the pure land

143
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
we all want to go to

144
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Amitabha's pure land

145
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
but the pure land

146
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
means our pure mind

147
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
when our mind is pure

148
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
we create the pure land

149
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
when our mind is evil

150
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
we create the corrupt world

151
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
so it is all because of our mind

152
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
this is called cassation

153
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
our mind is the cause of all things

154
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
so we need to have the correct thought

155
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
the correct mind

156
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
which is the pure mind

157
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
that is our original

158
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
pure true mind

159
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
that is the samadhi

160
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
samadhi of one context

161
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
when we are walking

162
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
standing

163
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
sitting

164
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
and lying down

165
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
we know who is the person

166
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
that is walking

167
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
that is standing

168
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
that is sitting

169
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
or lying down

170
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
they are the function of our mind

171
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
through the function

172
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
we need to reflect back

173
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
to our essence

174
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
the essence of our mind

175
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
we chant the name Amitabha

176
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
all day long

177
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
when we are walking

178
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
standing

179
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
sitting or lying down

180
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
is to remind us

181
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
we are one with Amitabha

182
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
because we all have the same Buddha nature

183
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
so by chanting and reciting his name

184
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
we are bringing out our true nature

185
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
in the Sragama Sutra

186
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
it says to be in control of the six senses

187
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
and purify our thoughts

188
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
chanting is controlling our six senses

189
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
our eyes

190
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
ears

191
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
tongue

192
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
body

193
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
and mind

194
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
we collect it inward

195
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
chanting the name Amitabha

196
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
that is how our mind is purified

197
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
so we often say

198
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
when you drop a clear pearl

199
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
into the muddy water

200
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
the muddy water will turn clear

201
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
when we chant the name Amitabha

202
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
in a distracted mind

203
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
the mind will resonate the Buddha

204
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
so every time we chant

205
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
is to purify our mind

206
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
so it's no longer chaotic

207
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and confused

208
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
in every action

209
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
we should be mindful of our true nature

210
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
by chanting and reciting

211
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Amitabha Buddha's name

212
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
that is the samadhi of one conduct

213
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
which means in one alignment

214
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
with our true nature

215
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
this is the same as Buddha remembrance

216
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
samadhi

217
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
or we call it chanting

218
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
of single-mindedness

219
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Patriarch Hui Nan says

220
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
one who perfects

221
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
the two forms of samadhi

222
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
is like the earth

223
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
in which the seeds are planted

224
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
buried into the ground

225
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
and they are being nourished

226
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
and is growing

227
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
ripening

228
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
and bearing fruit

229
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
this is the final verse

230
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
it says the my ground

231
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
contains all seeds

232
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
under the universal rain

233
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
they all sprout

234
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
sudden enlightenment

235
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
the flowers have bloomed

236
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
the Bodhi fruit itself

237
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
is self-fulfilling

238
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
our mind is the ground

239
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
that contains all seeds

240
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
the rain is the dharma

241
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Hui Nan Master's dharma

242
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
is like the tiny rain

243
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
moisturizing the seed

244
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
the seed is like our Buddha nature

245
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
that is receiving the moisture

246
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
from the rain

247
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
when we reach

248
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
sudden enlightenment

249
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
it's like the flower blooming

250
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
so with enough

251
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
samadhi of one form

252
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
and samadhi of one conduct

253
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
we'll definitely reach

254
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
sudden enlightenment

255
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
sudden enlightenment

256
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
it can be one instant

257
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
it can be one day

258
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
or it can be ten days

259
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
or ten years

260
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
when the time is right

261
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
and you accumulated enough effort

262
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
it will definitely bear fruit

263
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
the Bodhi fruit

264
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
is self-fulfilling

265
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
it is natural

266
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
because it is all within us

267
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
the two types of samadhi

268
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
they are innate in all of us

269
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
we are supposed to be

270
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
we are supposed to have

271
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
the right concentration

272
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
to be in control of our mind

273
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
at all times

274
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
there was a monk named

275
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Large Beads Hui Hai Master

276
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
he wanted to visit Master Ma Zu

277
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
so he traveled a long way

278
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
when he arrived

279
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Ma Zu Master asked him

280
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
where did you come from

281
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Hui Hai answered

282
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I came from the Da Yun Temple

283
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
in Yue Zhou

284
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Ma Zu asked

285
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
what do you want here

286
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Hui Hai answered

287
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm seeking for the Buddha Dharma

288
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Ma Zu answered

289
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I don't have anything here

290
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
what Dharma do you want

291
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
what is the point of leaving home

292
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
not attending to your own treasure

293
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Hui Hai asked

294
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
what treasure

295
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Ma Zu answered

296
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
this person asking

297
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
is the treasure

298
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
everything is sufficient

299
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
there's nothing lacking

300
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
or shortcoming

301
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
it can be used freely

302
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
so why seek for it externally

303
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
just that one sentence

304
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Hui Hai realized

305
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
certain enlightenment

306
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
so the person who is

307
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
walking

308
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
standing

309
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
sitting

310
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
lying down

311
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
is the Buddha

312
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
the mind is the Buddha

313
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
all we have to do is to

314
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
work diligently

315
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
work hard in our Samadhi

316
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
of one form

317
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
in combination with the Samadhi

318
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
of one conduct

319
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
one is wisdom

320
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
one is concentration

321
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
one is our understanding

322
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
one is our practice

323
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
if you combine the two

324
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
when the time is right

325
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
we will definitely attain

326
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
the wonderful Bodhi fruit

327
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
we will taste the wonderful fruit

328
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
of Bodhi

329
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
so that's the class today

330
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
thank you for listening

331
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Amitabha
