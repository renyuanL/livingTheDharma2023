1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,720
Today we are going to talk about eradicate desires.

2
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,840
The purpose of being a Buddhist is to reach Buddhahood.

3
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,960
How do we cultivate into Buddhahood?

4
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,840
Dedication is actually a process of eradicating our desires.

5
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,680
How do we do that on a daily basis?

6
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:46,960
In the Flower Adornment Sutra, it says when tempted by the five desires, vow that all

7
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,920
living beings will pull out the arrows of cravings and attain the ultimate peace.

8
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,920
This is Bodhisattva Manjushri praying for all sentient beings.

9
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:06,160
He vowed that myself and all sentient beings will pull out the arrows of cravings.

10
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,680
The cravings and desires are like poisonous arrows.

11
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,000
We think having all these desires will make us happy, but it's actually harming us.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,300
So we need to pull out the arrows.

13
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,140
That's how we attain ultimate peace.

14
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:27,160
So the ultimate peace is actually free ourselves from desires.

15
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,760
So what are the five desires?

16
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,520
The first is wealth.

17
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:38,920
We spend a lot of time trying to make money, trying to buy that big house, that fancy car,

18
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,640
the latest gadgets, because we think that's perfect life.

19
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:51,040
But if we spend all our time trying to have these material goods, we don't develop spiritually.

20
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,760
We're wasting our life on these material goods that's unreal.

21
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,760
Confucius' best student is Yan Hui.

22
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,760
Yan Hui is a Buddhist.

23
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,880
Yan Hui is extremely poor.

24
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,960
He used the bamboo skin as his bowl.

25
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:11,000
He used the melon shell as his spoon, and he lives off the street corner.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,640
Confucius says nobody can endure the suffering he's going through, but he is the happiest

27
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,120
person alive.

28
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,280
Why?

29
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,440
Because he found his spiritual self.

30
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,440
He found his soul.

31
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,520
He found his perfect virtue, wisdom, and compassion.

32
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,560
He found his perfect virtue, wisdom, and compassion.

33
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:28,720
He found his perfect virtue, wisdom, and compassion.

34
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,400
That's how he found his happiness.

35
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,240
So get rid of our material desires.

36
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,440
That's how we can reach our spiritual enlightenment.

37
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,520
Second is the desire of lust.

38
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,040
All of us have sexual desires.

39
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,840
That's why we are always reincarnating, living the samsara life.

40
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,840
That's the biggest problem.

41
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:58,560
Shurigami Sutra, it talks about a practitioner named Bhukushini.

42
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,600
Bhukushini, he has strong intense lust.

43
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,280
There was a Buddha named King of Emptiness.

44
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:13,640
He says anyone who has lustful desires, their body will be a raging mass of fire.

45
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:22,040
So the Buddha taught him to contemplate on the coolness and the warmness found throughout

46
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,340
his entire body.

47
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,360
So when we have lust, our temperature rise.

48
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,760
When we let go of the desire, it cools down.

49
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,800
Bhukushini keeps contemplating on the feeling and the temperature in his body.

50
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:46,040
There was a spiritual light that had collated and his fire of lust became fire of wisdom.

51
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,960
And then he reached perfect penetration.

52
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,080
That means perfect enlightenment.

53
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,260
And he became fire head.

54
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,740
That's what they called him.

55
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,480
And he made a great vow.

56
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,160
He was damned by all the Buddha.

57
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,460
He gave me herbs, chiamè,持 minor仇,现 CE.

58
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,940
So there was a spiritual thing Bunny that married the Buddha.

59
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,180
Known asançAT

60
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:10,000
So it's okay that we have problems, we have delusions, but use the environment to cultivate

61
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,540
diligently, and you will reach enlightenment and overcome defilements

62
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,540
opportunity.

63
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,840
The third one is desire for fame.

64
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:23,860
We all want to be that famous movie star or professional athlete.

65
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,560
Fame is like a dream abarrad, a bubble.

66
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:36,180
and a shadow. It's not real. We should live our life and pursue a job that we enjoy contributing

67
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:44,360
to mankind, not because you're chasing after fame. So know the purpose of our existence

68
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:51,560
and live a life without pursuing fame. The fourth is food. As a practitioner, if you

69
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:58,500
really want to cultivate this lifetime, reach deep samadhi or meditation skill, you need

70
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:05,800
to watch the food that you eat. We need to purify our food in order to develop spiritually.

71
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:12,340
So if you eat a lot of heavy food, when you meditate, you will become drowsy. If you eat

72
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:19,600
too little, you will become weak and restless. So we watch exactly what we eat for us to

73
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,540
be in the best physical state possible.

74
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:29,660
The fifth is sloth. Wasting a lot of time sleeping or resting or lying in the bed and

75
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:35,940
being sluggish. That's really wasting our life away. A practitioner usually sleeps four

76
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:44,020
to six hours a day. A good practitioner practices meditation about that amount of time. Your

77
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:50,320
diligence will make perfect. And that's how you reach deep concentration and how your

78
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,520
wisdom will really grow.

79
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:58,280
And that's how you reach enlightenment and Buddhahood. What you reap is what you sow.

80
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:06,560
So three out of these five are essential. We need money, we need food, and we need sleep.

81
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:13,760
Lust and fame, we don't need them at all. The three that we need, try to minimize, simplify

82
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:21,200
your life, simplify your needs, and you will have a lot more time to cultivate and enjoy

83
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,300
your practice.

84
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:31,860
We can also talk about the five desires in terms of our sensory pleasures. Our eyes like

85
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,500
to see forms. We like to look at attractive things. We have a certain way of doing our

86
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:43,520
hair, doing our nails, or buying the clothes that we wear because we want to be attractive.

87
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:50,200
But that's actually wasting our time. You can't be cultivating into Buddhahood. So let

88
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
go of the desire.

89
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:58,000
The third is smell. People put on perfumes. We like to listen to music. We are not used

90
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,780
to having silence. Like when you meditate, enjoy the silence of your mind. Just watching

91
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:16,600
your inhale and exhale. Let go of all thoughts in your mind. So learn to enjoy no sound.

92
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,300
Let go of the desire of sound.

93
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,400
The third is smell.

94
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:27,060
People put on perfume and burn nice incense or candles because that's how they derive

95
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:33,200
their pleasure from. But that's a worldly desire that can hurt your cultivation.

96
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:39,460
There was a practitioner up in the mountain. One day, he wanted to take a break. So he

97
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:46,160
started walking around and he found a beautiful lotus pond. He went by the pond and smelled

98
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,400
the lotus flower's fragrance.

99
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,400
All of a sudden, the water god came up to him. He said, I want to smell the lotus flower's

100
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,400
fragrance.

101
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:57,540
The water god came out and scolded him. How dare you steal the fragrance of my lotus flowers.

102
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,060
You should go back and meditate.

103
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:05,780
This practitioner knows that, yo, I am having a hidden desire that's coming out. I should

104
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,980
let it go.

105
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:13,040
But when he was about to leave, someone else came by. And this person, not only did he

106
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:19,160
smell the flowers, he picked them and trampled all over them and made a whole big mess. But,

107
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,660
the water god didn't say anything.

108
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:27,400
So, the practitioner asked the water god, how come you didn't say anything to him. He

109
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,620
made a whole big mess.

110
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:37,500
And the water god says, you are a practitioner. You are a cultivator. So you cannot have a

111
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:44,300
little ounce of defilement in you. That's why I have to scold you. But he is a mundane

112
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,800
person that's not at your level. So I don't want to be under your control. So I'm not

113
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,800
SBS.

114
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,800
This place, he gives lie. He does lies. He also calls me like that. He calls at my ears like

115
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:57,200
i don't need to say anything to him so when we are a practitioner we need to watch our mind carefully

116
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:06,000
watch our every thought and every desire because that's how you reach buddhahood by every day

117
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:14,800
watching your mind and letting go of your desires the fourth one is flavor we all want flavorful

118
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:22,400
food some people like spicy some people like sour or sweet and we really the right pleasure out of

119
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:29,360
that but if that's the purpose of your existence you're wasting the spiritual life the fifth is

120
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:37,840
called tactile sensation feeling of touch we want to lie on the soft bed or sofa we enjoy the soft

121
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:44,560
fabric that's why we buy very expensive clothing we don't understand we spend so much

122
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:53,700
time every day trying to satisfy our sensory desires and we have no time to cultivate and

123
00:09:53,700 --> 00:10:00,460
that's our samsara life if you really want to make something out of yourself this lifetime

124
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:10,560
try to let go of your desire it's like a dog gnawing on a decayed bone okay this metaphor

125
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:19,940
is extremely vivid a dog gnawing on the decayed bone it chews very very hard lips start bleeding

126
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:27,020
and he's actually eating his own blood but he think it's from the delicious bone that's what

127
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:35,380
we are doing we think this desire is making us happy enjoying life but it's actually harming us

128
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:40,400
that's causing us not reach buddhahood so understand the

129
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:40,540
truth

130
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:49,260
about the reality change ourselves and cultivate every day by watching our five desires that's how

131
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:57,600
we reach ultimate peace of having no desires so good luck with your cultivation you can do it
