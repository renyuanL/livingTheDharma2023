00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Today we are going to talk about the four essential practices of Pure Land Buddhism.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Not just for Pure Land practitioner, but it's actually for all schools of Buddhism.

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So as long as you are a person trying to go on a spiritual journey,

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
this is the four essential practices that we need to have.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The first one is called following precepts as the foundation.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,000
If you want to develop yourself spiritually and want to reach Buddhahood, this is the basic practice.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
There are lots of precepts, but they are based on three root precepts.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Abandoning evil, cultivate goodness, and benefit others.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It sounds very easy, right?

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Do not do evil, do all that is good, and benefit others.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
A three-year-old can understand, but an 80-year-old is still struggling to practice these three things.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So it's actually very difficult because we don't actually see when we are having offenses.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
For example, there were two practitioners talking.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
At first, they were talking about how great the Dharma is.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The heavenly beings came and spread fragrant flowers around them.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But after a while, these two practitioners started talking about the politics, their neighbors,

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
and started talking about all these things.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And the heavenly beings left.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And after a while, they started criticizing other people's practices and started complaining about their family.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So all the ghosts came and actually started spitting on them.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We don't know that a lot of negative karma are coming out of our speech.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So it's very important to watch what we say every day.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The key of being a good practitioner is do not lie to yourself.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Know your offenses.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Do not dwell on your mistakes.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Confess, change your ways, and move on.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
That's a healthy attitude of holding these precepts.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Number two, reborn into the pure land as refuge.

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Take on refuge.

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That means something we rely on.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We take refuge in the Triple Jewels, Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
This is our home.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's our shelter.

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's what's protecting us.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
We will always know that we have the pure land to go back to.

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Amitabha, he made 48 vows and created this Western pure land.

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
As long as we chant his name on our dying days, he will come get us and take us to his pure land.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That's our refuge.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That's our refuge.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That way you will not be afraid anymore.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
There are three parts to the pure land practice.

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Faith, vows, and practice.

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Faith is you really believe there's Amitabha Buddha.

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And you really know that there's a pure land for us to go to.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
This faith should be so strong it's like a baby relying on his or her mom.

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So we should rely and take refuge on the Amitabha Buddha.

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Know that he will protect us when you're very upset or when you're very afraid.

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Something great, wonderful happened to you, you still remember to go back to him and chant his name.

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Second, we need to have great vows.

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We really want to detach from this mundane world.

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's like a vicious cycle in this reincarnation.

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Amitabha gave us this place for us to be out of this jail forever and be free.

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So we should have strength.

54
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So we should have strong vow that this is what I really want.

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And this vow should be sincere.

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That should be the only thing that's on your mind.

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Like a mom who's very poor, all she wants to do is to support her kids.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
No matter what kind of hard labor job she's doing,

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
the only thing on her mind is I want my kid to live.

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And I need them to have food, shelter, and go to school.

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We want to leave this reincarnation life.

62
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Reach Buddhahood and come back and save all sentient beings.

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That should be the only thing on our mind.

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
There's no if and but.

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
This is your only thing that's on your mind 24 hours a day.

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Third is practices.

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Chanting Amitabha Buddha's name single-mindedly.

68
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's a kind of meditation.

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Every time we chant his name, we are clearing our mind.

70
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
We are going back to our true Buddha nature.

71
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
We're calm, peaceful, and we're one with the Buddha.

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
A cleaning pearl that filters the water.

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So when our hearts feel defilements,

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
keep chanting the Buddha's name.

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
We are Buddha.

76
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
We are glowing in this golden light.

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So that's the Buddha's golden light.

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
He's giving all his merit that he accumulated in eons of life.

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
He's putting all the goodness in his name.

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Every sound of Amitabha

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
is like a diamond.

82
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You're earning a diamond for yourself.

83
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Number three, find your Buddha nature as the destination.

84
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
We all have a destination.

85
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's to find our true Buddha nature,

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
our true self.

87
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Why do we meditate?

88
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
We meditate, watch our breathing,

89
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
so we can find ourselves, our heart, and our true mind.

90
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Our true mind has three components.

91
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The first is renunciation.

92
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We should have the heart of renunciation,

93
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
being free, no more reincarnation,

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
suffering of this endless birth and death.

95
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
How do we let it go?

96
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Letting go of your attachment to the self,

97
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
of your ego,

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
because that's the reason that we're reincarnating.

99
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Everything is impermanent,

100
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
and it's beyond your control.

101
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
When you let go, you are at peace,

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
and you will single-mindedly,

103
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
chain the Buddha's name.

104
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Only Amitabha can help us end the reincarnation.

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
That's the fastest way to reach Buddhahood.

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Number two, have the Bodhi mind.

107
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So not only you want to save yourself,

108
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
you want to save everyone else.

109
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
We're all in this samsara life of reincarnating.

110
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
We really want to come back and save all sentient beings.

111
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The Bodhi mind is essential

112
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
for Pure Land practitioner.

113
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
We're not going to the Pure Land for our own benefit.

114
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
We're going to the Pure Land for all sentient beings.

115
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The faster I become a Buddha,

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
the faster I come back and save everyone else.

117
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
When you have that kind of mentality,

118
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
every Amitabha has incredible power.

119
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So compassion and the Bodhi mind

120
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
is your true Buddha nature.

121
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The third is to have wisdom

122
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
of emptiness.

123
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
We need to understand emptiness.

124
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It doesn't mean things don't exist.

125
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It means everything that has a form is impermanent.

126
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It doesn't have an inherent essence to it.

127
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Nothing is for us to rely on.

128
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
That includes our notion of the self.

129
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So empty is actually empty of the self,

130
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
empty of the ego,

131
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
empty of the me, my, and I.

132
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
When you come to this realization,

133
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
it's true wisdom.

134
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So this true wisdom of Prajna

135
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
is very important for Pure Land practitioner.

136
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Only when you realize the emptiness,

137
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
you will discover your potential.

138
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
That chanting Amitabha's name,

139
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
that's when you're one with the Buddha.

140
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
All the time and space all become empty.

141
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You are Amitabha Buddha.

142
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Together as one entity and one essence.

143
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So with emptiness,

144
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
there comes infinite potential.

145
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So emptiness is a great wisdom.

146
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Number four,

147
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
have virtuous fellowship as support.

148
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
We need to have good friends.

149
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
That's good counsels,

150
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
helping us succeed in our endeavor.

151
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
We have three kinds of virtuous fellowship.

152
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The first is external supporters.

153
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
That means people who are helping you.

154
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So you have a shelter, food to eat and time to practice.

155
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
These are people who are supporting you.

156
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You should be very appreciative of these great external supporters.

157
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Without them, you will have no time and no place and no way to practice.

158
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Second, have fellow practitioners that are mutually encouraging and helping you to succeed.

159
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
There were two friends, they went to a seven-day meditation retreat.

160
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
But both of them, they could not handle the stress.

161
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
They're like, oh, this is too much. I cannot sit here for hours.

162
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So, you know, they both wanted to quit.

163
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Every time one of them opened their eyes to look at the other, the other person is meditating very diligently.

164
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So just by looking at each other for seven days, both of them finished the seven-day practice.

165
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And both of them reached very deep level of samadhi.

166
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So we need to have good friends that will help us.

167
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Along the way, and encourage us to improve and be diligent.

168
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Lastly, we need to have teachers.

169
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And how do we know is a good teacher?

170
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
If the teacher holds precepts.

171
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
If the teacher is a good practitioner that can help you, that really cares about your practice.

172
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
If you don't have good teacher, don't worry.

173
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Buddha says, when I'm gone, who is your teacher?

174
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Your teacher is the precepts.

175
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
As long as you follow the precepts,

176
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
abandon all that's evil, cultivate all that is good,

177
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
and try to benefit others,

178
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
you are with Buddha.

179
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Your teacher is with you.

180
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So you are safe to cultivate.

181
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
All four of these, they actually go hand in hand.

182
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You cannot succeed in your endeavor without all these four.

183
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And if you keep practicing these four together,

184
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
this lifetime, your spiritual journey will be successful.

185
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Okay, so that's the class for today.

186
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Thank you for listening.

187
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Amitabha.
