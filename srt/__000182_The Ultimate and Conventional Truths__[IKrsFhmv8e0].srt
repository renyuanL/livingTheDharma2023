1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Today we are going to talk about the ultimate and conventional truth.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So this follows the class from last week.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
There are two kinds of truth that we need to know.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
One is called the ultimate truth.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The ultimate truth is the truth of emptiness.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Everything happens is forever changing.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It doesn't have an inherent existence.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So we call it emptiness.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We should not attach ourselves to things that are forever changing

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
because in its essence, it's empty.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
When you are able to understand this truth, you become awakened.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And the second truth is called conventional truth.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Even though everything is empty in its essence,

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
it has its forms and what it appears.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So we still follow life and do the best that we can

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
but not be caught up with the world.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
If you balance the two kinds of truth, it's called the middle way.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
When you balance the two truths.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Today we are going to talk about the sixth patriarch of the Zen Buddhism.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
His name is Hui Nen.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
When he was really young, his father passed away.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So he had to chop wood for a living.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Never went to school, so he's illiterate.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
One day he was chopping wood and then he brought it to a hotel.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
He noticed someone was reciting the Diamond Sutra.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
He asked the person, where did you get the sutra?

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
How can I find someone who teaches me?

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
He said, oh, you just go to the Huangmei Mountain.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The fifth patriarch of the Zen Buddhism is there teaching right now.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Hui Nen decided to leave his home.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
He walked for 30 days.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Finally, he gets there.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The fifth patriarch Hong Ren asked him, who are you?

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Why are you here?

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
He says, my name is Hui Nen.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm from the South.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm here because I want to be a Buddha.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And then he said, you are just a barbarian from the South

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and you want to be a Buddha?

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
He was looking down on him and he said,

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
people might be from South or North,

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
but the Buddha nature

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
has no South or North.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I can be a Buddha.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So he was very, very confident in his own nature.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The fifth patriarch said, just go to the kitchen and pound rice.

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So he ordered him to go to the kitchen and work.

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
He worked in the kitchen for eight months.

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
One day the fifth patriarch gathered his disciples and said,

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm going to die soon.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So I want to pass my patriarchship to someone who's enlightened.

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So I'm going to have you guys write a poem.

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Whoever writes the best poem that shows that you're enlightened,

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I will give my robe to the person.

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You'll be the next patriarch.

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So everybody's like, we don't need to write

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
because the head monk in the temple,

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
he is the best student.

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm sure he's going to write the best poem.

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Everybody points to Sen Xiu.

61
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
But Sen Xiu, he's very nervous at this point.

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
He said, everybody thinks I'm going to be the best one.

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What if I'm not enlightened?

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What will people think of me?

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
He couldn't sleep.

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
But finally, he wrote this poem.

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Body is the Bodhi tree.

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Mind is like a bright mirror on a stand.

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Diligently wipe it all the time and allow no dust to cling.

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Okay, so what does that mean?

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The body is the Bodhi tree.

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So we cultivate with our body to become a Bodhi tree

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
because Buddha was enlightened under the Bodhi tree.

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So we have this metaphor saying

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
our body is like the Bodhi tree of cultivation.

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
We use the body to cultivate.

77
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And the mind is like a bright mirror.

78
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
We often describe our Buddha nature like clean mirror.

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So what you have to do is diligently wipe it all the time

80
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
and allow no dust to cling.

81
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So you just don't want any dust.

82
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You want to make sure you have no anger,

83
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
no greediness, ignorance.

84
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You clean yourself every day.

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So that's his poem.

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So do you think that's enlightenment?

87
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Hui Neng was in the kitchen

88
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
and he heard someone reciting this poem.

89
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
He said, that person is not enlightened.

90
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I have a better poem.

91
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So one bystander showed him to the corridor

92
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
where this was written.

93
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So he asked someone to write another poem for him.

94
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And this is what he wrote.

95
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Originally Bodhi is not a tree

96
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
nor does the bright mirror have a stand.

97
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Originally there's not even a tree.

98
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So where is the thing?

99
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So where is the dust to cling?

100
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
These two poems are the opposite.

101
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
First, the body is a Bodhi tree.

102
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Originally Bodhi is not a tree.

103
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What does that mean?

104
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Enlightenment or Buddha nature,

105
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
does it have a form?

106
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
No.

107
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's formless.

108
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's nothing physical.

109
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Nor does the bright mirror have a stand.

110
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Buddha nature is not in the form of a mirror

111
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
or anything that you think is great or clean.

112
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Because originally there's not even a thing.

113
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
This is the concept of the ultimate truth.

114
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Everything is empty in its essence.

115
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
When you cling to something,

116
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
that's no longer your Buddha nature.

117
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So where is the dust to cling?

118
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
There's no mirror and it's not dirty.

119
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
There's no dirt.

120
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You are clean and pure as it is.

121
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
There's nothing to cling.

122
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You are perfect as it is.

123
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You just have to let go of your attachment

124
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
and you'll be there.

125
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The 5th Patriarch, he realized

126
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Hui Nung is enlightened

127
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
and then he passed the robe to him.

128
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
But everybody was jealous of him.

129
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So he disguised himself as a hunter

130
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
in the hunting group for 16 years

131
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
before he started teaching the Dharma of Zen Buddhism.

132
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
That's the legend of Hui Nung.

133
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So why do we discuss these two poems?

134
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Just to let you understand

135
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
what's the ultimate truth

136
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
and what's the conventional truth.

137
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Conventional truth is what you see.

138
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
A lot of us are very caught up

139
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
with the conventional truth,

140
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
what appears on the outside.

141
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
We might be nervous.

142
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Oh, I have to be a good mom.

143
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I have to do my job well.

144
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
We are like sensual.

145
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Caught up in the conventional world.

146
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I have to be great at this and that.

147
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
If I don't do well,

148
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
what are people going to think of me?

149
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But if you're really, really awakened,

150
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
you don't have to worry about all that.

151
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You can work hard but no stress.

152
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Why?

153
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Because everything is empty in its essence.

154
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
When you find out the emptiness,

155
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
you feel liberated

156
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
because you have no more worries.

157
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Life, the result is empty.

158
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
At the end, there's nothing for you to attach to.

159
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
When you come to that sense of enlightenment,

160
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
understanding the ultimate truth,

161
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
we will reach our Buddhahood.

162
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Next time, we're going to talk more

163
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
about these two truths in another way.

164
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Thank you for listening.

165
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Amitabha.
