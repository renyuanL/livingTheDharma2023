1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Today is our first class.

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So I will start from the beginning of how to meditate.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So when we meditate, the first thing we do is to adjust our posture.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
There are seven ways to adjust our posture.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
When you sit, it's from the bottom to top.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And when you exit, you go from top to bottom.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Remember the seven positions.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
First, you adjust your legs.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If you can, try to do the full lotus.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This is called a full lotus.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Both feet are up to where your thigh is.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
If you can, don't worry.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Just do half a lotus.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Or any way you like to cross your legs.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
As long as you cross your legs.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Or you sit on this chair, that's fine too.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Any way you like to sit.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The purpose is for us to go into this happy peaceful mode.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Any position you like to sit.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
But make it straight, comfortable, and relaxing.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The second thing that you adjust is your spine, your vertebrae.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You want to make sure your back is fully erect.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Don't try to force it straight.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It should be natural.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You're naturally built to be straight.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You're not naturally to be crooked.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Your true Buddha nature will come out when you're very straight.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So make sure your back is as straight as you can get it to be.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So that's the second thing you have to adjust.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The third is your hands.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Put your left hand on the bottom.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Right hand on the top.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And your thumb gently touch each other.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And place it in your lap.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Make sure the two are even.

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Don't be lopsided or one side up.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And make sure it's comfortable.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So now we move up to our shoulders.

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
No slouching ever.

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You gotta open up your chest so it's all the way back.

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And no slouching.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Relax and straight.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That's the purpose of adjusting our shoulders.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What's the fifth one?

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We move up to our head.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Make sure our head is straight.

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's not tilted this way or up.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It should be a little bit tucked in but not all the way down.

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Not to one side or the other.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
When you look on the side, it should be very well placed in the center.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The sixth is make sure your mouth is a little bit smiling.

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Smiling.

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Smiling will relax the muscles in your face so you can go into this deep concentration.

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So smile as if you're seeing Buddha.

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Very happy.

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The happiest place on earth.

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Your thumb touches the roots of your mouth where your gums and your teeth touch.

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It will generate this very good soul.

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Very good saliva that will nourish your body.

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Lastly, close your eyes so you can focus.

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
If you can't close your eyes because you will fall asleep,

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,000
then you can open 30% and look down on the floor right in front of you.

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
But don't look around.

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Forget about where you are or who you are.

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Just right here.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Right now, looking at the floor or close your eyes.

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Concentrate.

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So that's the seventh way to adjust your body, your posture,

69
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,000
so you can go into samadhi, which means deep concentration.

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
From top to bottom.

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Relax your forehead.

72
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Your eyes.

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Your neck.

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Your shoulders.

75
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Your arms.

76
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
depart your surroundings.

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Your upper body.

78
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Pelvis.

79
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Eyes.

80
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Your knees.

81
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Your knees.

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Your feet.

83
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Your bones.

84
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Your knees.

85
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Now, each leg again.

86
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
From bottom to top.

87
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Relax your toes.

88
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Relax your feet.

89
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Relax your legs.

90
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Relax your knees.

91
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Straight back.

92
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Pelvis.

93
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Down low.

94
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:41,980
Relax your arms, your shoulders, and relax your neck, your cheeks, and your shoulders.

95
00:07:42,000 --> 00:08:11,980
Relax your arms, your shoulders, and relax your neck, your cheeks, and your shoulders.

96
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,680
Our breathing.

97
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:30,540
The way to go into deep meditation is by focusing your attention on your breathing.

98
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:36,500
Don't try to change your breathing.

99
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,260
Just observe it.

100
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,040
Observe your breathing.

101
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,320
That is the only thing in the world at this moment.

102
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,780
Enjoy your breathing.

103
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,420
Enjoy how you're breathing.

104
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,180
Now we count our breathing.

105
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:23,780
Every inhale, exhale, count one.

106
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,380
All the way up to five.

107
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,420
Make it into a cycle.

108
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:40,780
If there are wandering thoughts, just observe it and ignore it.

109
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,840
Go back to your counting.

110
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,840
Inhale.

111
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,840
Exhale.

112
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,840
One.

113
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,840
Inhale.

114
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,840
Exhale.

115
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,840
Two.

116
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,840
One.

117
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,840
Two.

118
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,840
Two.

119
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,840
Two.

120
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,840
One.

121
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,840
Two.

122
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,840
Two.

123
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,840
One.

124
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,840
Two.

125
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,840
Two.

126
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,840
Two.

127
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,840
One.

128
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,840
Two.

129
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,840
Two.

130
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,840
Two.

131
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,840
Two.

132
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,080
Two.

133
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,080
One.

134
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,080
One.

135
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,080
Two.

136
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,080
One.

137
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,080
Two.

138
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,080
One.

139
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,600
One.

140
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,600
Two.

141
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,600
Three.

142
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,600
One.

143
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,600
Two.

144
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Two.

145
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,600
One.

146
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,600
Two.

147
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,600
Two.

148
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,600
One.

149
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,600
Two.

150
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,600
One.

151
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Two.

152
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
Two.

153
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
Three.

154
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,600
woo

155
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,440
Inhale.

156
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,300
Three.

157
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:56,300
We all want our training to be loud, to be quiet and soft.

158
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:02,300
Now we count one through five by ourselves.

159
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:33,300
In the Flower Adornment Sutra, it says,

160
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:40,300
Our mind is like an artist.

161
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:49,300
Who can paint the entire world.

162
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:57,300
From this, the five skandhas arise.

163
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:07,300
As well as all phenomena.

164
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,300
Our mind is like an artist.

165
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:17,300
We can paint a beautiful world if we like.

166
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:27,300
Or we can paint a very ugly picture by negative emotion.

167
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:36,300
It's all up to us what we are going to paint for our life.

168
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,300
We have a right to paint.

169
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,300
We have a right to choose.

170
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:51,300
And by meditating, we can be in touch with our true Buddha nature.

171
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:57,300
Pureness and happiness.

172
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:02,300
The five skandhas arise.

173
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:07,300
What are the five skandhas?

174
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:13,300
Skandhas also means aggregates.

175
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:23,300
Buddha says our mind and body consist of five aggregates.

176
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,300
The first is form.

177
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:33,300
The form aggregate means our body.

178
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,300
Our mind controls our body.

179
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:43,300
If you think I'm always sick, I'll always be sick.

180
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:48,300
It's all up to your mind.

181
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:53,300
The second skandha is our feelings.

182
00:13:53,300 --> 00:14:02,300
We have the feeling of pleasure, displeasure, and neutral.

183
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:06,300
It's all up to us on how to feel.

184
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:14,300
The third aggregate is our perceptions.

185
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:22,300
Perception is based on how we like or dislike.

186
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,300
Hot or cold.

187
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,300
Nice or mean.

188
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,300
That's how we perceive.

189
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:35,300
This perception is also based on our feelings.

190
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:39,300
It's also based on our mind.

191
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:44,300
We can change how we perceive the world.

192
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:49,300
If I think everybody is mean.

193
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,300
Everybody is mean.

194
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,300
If I think everyone is my friend.

195
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:00,300
They are all wonderful people in my life.

196
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,300
The fourth aggregate is our feelings.

197
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:10,300
The fourth aggregate is mental formation.

198
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:23,300
It's our perception going into a deeper level of labeling, discrimination, prejudice, or all kinds of judgment.

199
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:30,300
This is also up to us to change.

200
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,300
The last skandha is mental formation.

201
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,300
It's our consciousness.

202
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:41,300
It consists of higher three skandhas.

203
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:47,300
Feeling, perception, and formation.

204
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:52,300
The whole thing is called consciousness.

205
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:57,300
We can paint a wonderful life for ourselves.

206
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:02,300
If we can just change our mind the way that we're supposed to be.

207
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:13,300
Everything in this world is created by our thoughts.

208
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:19,300
Through meditation and deep concentration,

209
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:29,300
we are able to control our thoughts to be in line with our true Buddha nature.

210
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,300
Perfect and pure.

211
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:43,300
That is a short way of contemplation.

212
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:53,300
Now we go back to count our breathing.

213
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,300
Inhale.

214
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,300
Exhale.

215
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,300
One.

216
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,300
Two.

217
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,300
Three.

218
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,300
Four.

219
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,300
Five.

220
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,300
Six.

221
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,300
Seven.

222
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,300
Eight.

223
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,300
Nine.

224
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,300
10.

225
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,300
11.

226
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,300
12.

227
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,300
13.

228
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,300
14.

229
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,300
15.

230
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,300
16.

231
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,300
17.

232
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,300
18.

233
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,300
19.

234
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,300
20.

235
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,300
21.

236
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,300
22.

237
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,300
23.

238
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,300
24.

239
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,300
25.

240
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,300
26.

241
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,300
27.

242
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,300
32.

243
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,300
33.

244
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,300
34.

245
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,300
25.

246
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,300
26.

247
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:52,800
Four, inhale, exhale, five, now count by yourself.

248
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:59,800
If you start having wandering thoughts, then start over from one.

249
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:52,780
If you start having wandering thoughts, then start over from one.

250
00:18:52,800 --> 00:19:22,780
If you start having wandering thoughts, then start over from one.

251
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:30,800
When we exhale, we relax from the top to the bottom.

252
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:36,800
So relax your legs first.

253
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:42,800
Now you rub your hands.

254
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,800
Put it on your eyes.

255
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:50,800
That will give you good eyesight.

256
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,800
Now rub again.

257
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:59,800
And rub your whole head all the way to your ears.

258
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:07,800
You can use a little force, it's fine.

259
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:16,800
Now massage your arms.

260
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,800
And make it hot again.

261
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,800
And put it on your waist.

262
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,800
That's how you have good kidneys.

263
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:38,800
Now you rub your legs because you haven't moved for 45 minutes.

264
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,800
So you have to protect it.

265
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,800
So the next time, you can sit for longer.

266
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:53,800
So everybody did really well for the first time.

267
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,800
Everybody's really good.

268
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,800
Thank you.

269
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,800
