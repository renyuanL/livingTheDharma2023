1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,740
Today we are going to talk about fate.

2
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,780
Last time we talked about karma.

3
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:28,680
So everything that's happened to you right now is because of your words, your thoughts,

4
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,520
and your actions from before.

5
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:37,080
Your merit and demerit that caused the relationship you are having in this lifetime.

6
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:43,300
All the relationships, your parents, your children, your siblings, and even people you

7
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,000
meet on the street, there is fate involved.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,100
There are four types of relationships.

9
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,420
All relationships fall into one of the four categories.

10
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,620
The first one is to repay your kindness.

11
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:04,560
There are people that are in your life, you did good things to them before, now they are

12
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,400
here to pay you back.

13
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,820
They are the people that loves you, that take care of you, that's nice to you.

14
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,340
So they are the people that's in your life to repay your kindness.

15
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:22,120
Second, there are people in your life to revenge.

16
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:26,520
You did something wrong to them before, now they are in your life to sabotage you.

17
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,520
The third category is to repay your kindness.

18
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,520
The third category is to pay your kindness.

19
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:37,200
third type to solicit karmic debt. Debt is not money. Debt is the merit and the demerit

20
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,560
that you did to them. So they are here to take it back. You owe them. They are here

21
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:51,180
to take it back. And there are also people in your life to repay the karmic debt. They

22
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:58,940
owe you. So they are paying you back this lifetime. Everyone in your life is because

23
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:07,200
of the four types of relationships. The first is repaying kindness. Some people are in your

24
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,120
life to pay back all the good things you did to them in your prior lifetimes. There is

25
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,900
a man. He fell in love with this wonderful woman. They've been together for three years.

26
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,700
They had a wonderful relationship.

27
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:28,660
The man was asking her to get married. The lady decided to marry someone else. The guy

28
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:37,040
was devastated. He said, why is this happening? His dad found him a monk to help him. The

29
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:43,180
monk said, oh, you must be tired. Why don't you take a nap? The man took a nap. He had

30
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:50,640
a dream. He dreamt of a woman that died on the beach. The first guy walked by, didn't

31
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,140
do anything.

32
00:02:51,180 --> 00:03:00,140
The second guy walked by, felt sorry for the lady, put his jacket on her to cover her up.

33
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:08,720
The third guy walked by actually buried her respectfully. So the man woke up and told

34
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:16,620
the monk about the dream. The monk said, you know what? Your girlfriend was that lady in

35
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,640
your prior lifetime. You were the second guy that covered her up.

36
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:29,980
She is paying you back for three years for that kindness. But now she's marrying the

37
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:37,920
third person because the third person actually buried her. That's called paying back kindness.

38
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,920
A lot of people in our life that are kind to us, that's because we did good things to

39
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:48,600
them. So always do good things to people. The second type of relationship, they are

40
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,600
here for revenge.

41
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,600
The second type of relationship, they are here for revenge. In the middle of the night,

42
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:57,220
in the Ming Dynasty, there is a Mr. Fang. Mr. Fang is the most well-known scholar. He

43
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:05,580
helps the emperor to rule the country. Unfortunately, there was a tyrant that came, invaded the country

44
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:14,080
and took over. He asked Mr. Fang, the scholar, to write the announcement to the entire country

45
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:20,060
about the new emperorship. Mr. Fang refused. He fiercely refused. The tyrant was very upset.

46
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:30,760
So he beheaded Mr. Fang and his whole 9th generation plus the 10th generation, which is his teacher,

47
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:41,040
for a total of 873 people. He beheaded them. Why did this happen to him? This goes back

48
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:48,880
to Mr. Fang's dad. Before Mr. Fang was born, he wanted to find a good burial site for his

49
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,880
family.

50
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:57,420
One day, he finally found the perfect location and he decided to excavate the burial plot

51
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:04,240
the next day. But that night, he dreamed of an old man wearing red, came to him and

52
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:11,300
pleaded, please delay the digging because my family is not living there. Please give

53
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:16,920
us three days to move. We need three days. Just give us three days. Mr. Fang's dad woke

54
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,000
up. He ignored the dream. The next day, he started digging. He was terrified. He was

55
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
afraid to do this. He was afraid to do this. He was afraid to do this. He was afraid to

56
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
do this. He was afraid. He was afraid to do this. He was afraid to do this. He was afraid.

57
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,700
digging. They found a huge nest of red snakes. He was disgusted by the sight. He actually

58
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:39,780
light a torch and burned all the snakes. A total of 873 snakes. So why did Mr. Fong came

59
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:50,000
to his dad to be his son? He is here for revenge. So whatever you do to people, it will always

60
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,380
come back to you. So do not do evil deeds and hurt other people's lives. The third type

61
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:04,060
is people that are here to take back karmic debt. And there are people that are paying

62
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:11,560
you back for good things that you did. This is a story about when Buddha was around. One

63
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:19,340
day when he was teaching his disciple, he told Ananda, Ananda, you go into the village

64
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:19,980
and

65
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:24,820
he asked the lady by the well for a bucket of water.

66
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:30,020
Ananda went into the village and then really saw an old lady next to the well.

67
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,860
He asked, may I please have a bucket of water?

68
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,700
The lady looked at him and said,

69
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,940
This water is only for our villagers.

70
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,660
You don't belong here, please leave.

71
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,140
She was very upset.

72
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:48,900
So Ananda went back to Buddha and told him what happened.

73
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,100
Buddha said, very well.

74
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,440
Sariputta, another student of Buddha,

75
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:01,040
you go now to the city and find the old lady and ask for a bucket of water.

76
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,180
So Sariputta went and the old lady saw him.

77
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:10,180
She was elated and immediately gave him a bucket of water.

78
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,460
She went home, got him a lot of food and offered it to him.

79
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:18,900
So Sariputta went back to Buddha and told him what happened.

80
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:23,380
And then everybody asked Buddha, why the big difference?

81
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:29,580
Buddha said, once there was a rat that died on the street.

82
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:34,740
There was a businessman that walked by, was disgusted by the dead rat.

83
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,260
He pinched his nose and then walked away.

84
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,560
The second guy was a student.

85
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,360
He saw the dead rat and buried the rat respectfully.

86
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,160
The old lady by the well was very upset.

87
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,200
The old lady by the well was very upset. The old lady by the well was very upset.

88
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,900
The old lady by the well was very upset.

89
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,100
The old lady by the well was very upset.

90
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:56,000
Ananda you were the first person that was disgusted by the rat.

91
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,180
That's why the lady hated you, because you were disgusted by her.

92
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:06,360
And Sariputta you were the student that buried the rat.

93
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:11,020
That's why she loves you and is paying you back.

94
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:18,220
Ok, so everything has a reason, everybody in your life has a reason.

95
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:18,500
But now in the future, you feel like you are someone, you want to be someone, you want to be someone.

96
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:18,600
But now in the future, you feel like you are someone, you want to be someone, you want to be someone.

97
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:18,820
So Sariputta Danny beat Buddha.

98
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:18,900
So Sariputta Danny beat Buddha.

99
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:27,460
know about karma and faith we want to do all that is good so in Confucius teaching there is a very

100
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:37,220
good saying that sums up this four relationship it says kindness should be repaid let enmity just

101
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:47,260
fade away grudges are better forgotten make kindness grow day by day okay so this is actually

102
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:55,020
a poem kindness should be repaid all the people that are nice to us we want to be nicer to them

103
00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:01,740
have more love for them respect them and appreciate their kindness that the kindness will keep growing

104
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:09,080
let enmity just fade away if there's any hatred or people here in your life to sabotage you

105
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:16,800
just forget about it and move on now let it fade away do not remember all the demerit that they do

106
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,240
to you

107
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:25,260
grudges are better forgotten don't hold grudges because that will only give you more negative

108
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:33,300
karma if you want good karma don't hold any grudges you want to make kindness and love

109
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:41,760
grow day by day only love is the solution if you want to have good relationships in your future

110
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,620
life just be nice to people and give people love kindness

111
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,220
and grudges

112
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:54,420
compassion so this is the class for today hope that we're all fine in our heart to do good deeds

113
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:58,240
and change our life for the better thank you for listening
