1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,160
Today we will talk about wholesome and unwholesome thoughts.

2
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,760
Our mind is like an artist that can paint the entire world.

3
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,280
From this the five skandhas arise as well as all phenomena.

4
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,880
Our mind is a great artist that creates the universe.

5
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,200
We can either paint a beautiful life for ourselves or we can paint a miserable life, it's all

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,200
up to us.

7
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,900
In this class, we will learn 11 wholesome thoughts and 10 unwholesome thoughts in order

8
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,380
to transform our lives with our thoughts.

9
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,680
Let's first look at the 11 wholesome thoughts.

10
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,680
Number one is faith.

11
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,640
We must have faith in karma, that's called the conventional truth.

12
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,920
If we have wholesome thoughts, it will create good karma.

13
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,740
If we have unwholesome thoughts, it will create negative karma.

14
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:06,240
Believing in the law of causation, that's the basis of our cultivation.

15
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,240
On the other hand, we should believe in the ultimate truth, it's that beyond all the cause

16
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,200
and effect, there is emptiness as the essence of all things.

17
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,360
This emptiness is our pure one mind, the pure nature.

18
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:27,400
So regardless if you're wholesome or unwholesome, this pure mind never changes, so by believing

19
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:33,160
and balancing these two truths, our mind will be very strong and powerful, then we

20
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:38,740
can conquer all doubts, worries, and fears in our cultivation.

21
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,000
Number two is diligence.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,300
We need to put in effort in our cultivation to avoid all evil and cultivate all that is

23
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,300
good.

24
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:53,400
This diligence is based on strong courage and strength.

25
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,720
This courage and strength actually comes from our belief.

26
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,480
The stronger our faith, the more diligent we will be.

27
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,500
It's not the busier you are, the more diligent you are.

28
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:08,220
Sometimes a person who's very diligent, but if you look at him, he's very relaxed and

29
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:14,660
not doing much because he's actually quietly working on his defilements.

30
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,720
That is true diligence.

31
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,000
Number three is modesty.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,720
Number four is shame.

33
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,480
These two often go together.

34
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,760
Modesty is when we are humble and respectful.

35
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,700
It's when we are humble and respectful.

36
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,420
We want to learn from all the virtuous people.

37
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,340
Shame is when we're embarrassed of our wrongdoings.

38
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,460
So these two are both self-reflection.

39
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:41,500
So when things go wrong, do not blame others or the outside situation.

40
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:47,560
Always go inward and reflect on ourselves, but this reflection is not a strong sense

41
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,840
of guilt or remorse because those would be defilement and unwholesome.

42
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,480
We want this modesty and shame to be positive and wholesome.

43
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,480
We want to learn from all the virtuous people.

44
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,760
Just note that we're always learning and life is a growing experience.

45
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,760
Number five is non-greed.

46
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,820
Number six is non-anger.

47
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,820
Number seven is non-ignorance.

48
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,760
Greed, anger, and ignorance that's the three poisons.

49
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,760
Without them, that's the three good roots.

50
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,060
That's a basis for all goodness.

51
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,200
Non-greed is when we are content.

52
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:15,520
We are no longer seeking or craving, we are no longer living our lives.

53
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:26,320
This is the basis for our goodness.

54
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,300
for things that were not supposed to crave for. There were two monks in the Song Dynasty.

55
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:37,400
They were fleeting in the wartime. Each one of them was carrying a backpack.

56
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:43,760
Monk A noticed that Monk B kept looking into his own bag. When Monk B went to the bathroom,

57
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:50,300
Monk A looked into the Monk B's bag and found a pure gold hairpin. Monk A threw away

58
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:56,080
this precious metal. When Monk B came back, he was looking for his prized possession.

59
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:02,700
Monk A told him, We are both monks. We are seeking liberation. How can you still hold

60
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:09,760
on to contamination? I already threw away that poisonous snake. Monk B realized his

61
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,840
craving, and his fall, and changed his way. So do not be greedy.

62
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:24,080
Number six is non anger. When things don't go our way, can we not be angry? There was

63
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,080
an ugly small ghost.

64
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:32,120
ghost that went up to the heavens of the 33 gods and actually sat on the throne. All the

65
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:38,480
heavenly beings were yelling at her but surprisingly the more they yelled at her, the prettier,

66
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:45,200
stronger and bigger she got. The king of the heavens of the 33 gods came and saw the ghost

67
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:51,580
but he was not angry at her at all. He was very polite and very respectful. He just repeated

68
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:59,160
three times, I am the king of the heavens of the 33 gods. As he was repeating, surprisingly

69
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:07,180
the ghost shrunk and got uglier and soon she disappeared. Why? Because this ghost symbolizes

70
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:13,420
our anger. The more you are angry, the more you feel it, the stronger it gets. But if

71
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:21,040
you don't be angry and be respectful and compassionate, this anger will subside and can no longer

72
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,540
control us.

73
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:33,020
7. Non-ignorance. Understand the Four Noble Truths. Know what is the cause of our suffering.

74
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:38,740
For example, we don't want to be grumbling about the past or worrying about the future

75
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:45,520
or think about all the irrelevant things that cannot be helpful. Only focus on relevant

76
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:51,040
thoughts that are wholesome, that can improve and transform our lives. So don't dwell

77
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,640
on emotional drawbacks. That's ignorance.

78
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:02,120
8. Tranquility. That's when we're having serenity. The calmness of our body and mind

79
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:08,540
because of the absence of defilement. We feel this lightness and carefree blissfulness.

80
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:16,860
9. Vigilance. This is strong self-discipline. So no matter what, we should remember the

81
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,480
danger of samsara and the fault of birth and death.

82
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:20,980
10. Self-discipline. This is the most important part of self-discipline. We should remember the danger of samsara and the fault of birth and death.

83
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:28,640
We don't want to be lazy because we're having short-lived pleasant experiences right now.

84
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,360
We always want to guard and protect our mind. That's vigilance.

85
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:42,000
10. Equanimity. This is letting go. We have to let go of all our emotional attachments.

86
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:49,260
Even when you're praying for the sick person, you have to let go. In your meditation, say

87
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,480
to yourself,

88
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:58,420
Everyone is subject to one's own karma. You'll feel this neutral feelings and indifference.

89
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:04,240
This is actually the best state of mind when you're not attached and this is actually true

90
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,240
compassion.

91
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:12,740
11. Harmlessness. We don't want to hurt anyone with our thoughts or with our actions. This

92
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:18,920
world is already full of suffering and danger. We want people to feel safe when they're with

93
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,920
us.

94
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:25,140
We know we will not harm them. We will not take advantage of them. We should synchronize

95
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:29,800
ourselves with these 11 wholesome thoughts. That's how we transform our lives for the

96
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,800
better.

97
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,680
Now let's look at the 10 unwholesome thoughts.

98
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,800
1. Hatred. At the moment of rage when unpleasant situations are happening.

99
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,680
2. Vengeance. When we hold on to the hatred afterwards.

100
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,680
3. Taxation. When the vengeance develops into our anger.

101
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,680
4. Rebellion. When we hold on to the hatred afterwards.

102
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,680
5. Rebellion. When we hold on to the hatred afterwards.

103
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,680
6. Rebellion. When we hold on to the hatred afterwards.

104
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,680
5. Rebellion. When we hold on to the hatred afterwards.

105
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,940
When we hold on to our bodily action and speech, we become very violent.

106
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,320
So all three of these are based off of anger.

107
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:02,320
Number 4 is concealment. When we try to hide our mistakes, because we

108
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:07,900
try to protect our image. When we're doing this, we are actually breaking more precepts

109
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,860
and we're just lying to ourselves.

110
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:16,560
Number 5 is deceiving. It's kind of like concealment but this is straight out pretending

111
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,560
and lying.

112
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,440
So the intention is to lie.

113
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,440
ar müssen aufhören.

114
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,600
lie to others. On the outside, we look very virtuous and wholesome, but the inside is

115
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:32,560
full of darkness and defilements. Number six is flattery, adulation, brown-nosing to the

116
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:38,840
boss and the superior to gain favors. Actually, kids do this a lot. They are very sweet in

117
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:43,760
front of the parents and the teacher just to get what they want, but it's actually very

118
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:51,700
unwholesome. Number seven is pride, when we're drunken by our own ego, self-infatuated because

119
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:57,880
of our good looks or success or accomplishments or skills, but this is actually the cause

120
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:05,880
of suffering and samsara. Number eight is harmfulness, malice, and hostility. This can

121
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:12,400
be very subtle. For example, I just have a dog. She's so annoying. That is already being

122
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,040
harmful.

123
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:20,400
Number nine is jealousy, when we cannot bear the success and the accomplishment of others.

124
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:27,720
This is also because of our selfishness and anger. Number ten is parsimony, when we are

125
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:33,320
stingy with our money and the dharma because we don't want to share. We just want to hug

126
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:39,320
it up for ourselves, our family, or our temple. This is all because of our selfishness. These

127
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,480
ten are called minor or secondary.

128
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:42,980
Okay.

129
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:48,380
These are all unwholesome mental functions, but they're actually the strongest. So they

130
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:55,380
break down into the three poisons. Hatred, vengeance, vexation, harmfulness, and jealousy.

131
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:03,660
That's from anger. Concealment, deceiving, and flattery. Those three are based on our

132
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:10,660
ignorance. Pride and parsimony, that's based on our greed. So these are all because of

133
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,420
the three poisons.

134
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:19,040
We need to look into our mind. Be mindful of our thoughts, be mindful when we're having

135
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:24,540
unwholesome thoughts or wholesome thoughts. We do not want to judge them, just know to

136
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:29,580
let go of the unwholesome thought and synchronize with the wholesome thought. That's how we

137
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,480
transform our life and purify our minds.

138
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:39,060
There was a spiritual leader. His name was William Dyer. He passed away a few years ago.

139
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,060
When he was just an infant, his father left him, taking care of his health. His name just

140
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,060
appeared right now, on the tree calls to him Geb chambers. Him you start off inpecting

141
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,060
more compassion. You find yourself personally affected by karmic affects. You see karmic affects,

142
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:47,740
He grew up in a series of orphanages so he grew up hating his father and the hate grew

143
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,680
stronger and stronger as he got older.

144
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:56,100
He became an alcoholic, he was overweight and he had really bad relationships.

145
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,900
Everything was not going right.

146
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:02,320
So until he was 34, he decided to go look for his father.

147
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,780
His father already passed away for 10 years.

148
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,540
He wanted to see his grave.

149
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,040
Finally, he went to Mississippi and found his grave.

150
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,880
He was there for 3 hours.

151
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:17,120
At the beginning, he was still very angry but at the end, he had an epiphany.

152
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,500
He finally said to his father, I forgive you for everything.

153
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,760
From now on, I only send you love.

154
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,220
From that moment on, Dr. Wayne Dyer transformed his life.

155
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:35,120
He became a spiritual leader that helped millions grow spiritually.

156
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,760
So we can all transform our lives just by knowing our thoughts and letting go of our

157
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,760
defilements.

158
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:50,000
In Buddhism, we call it transforming afflictions into bodhi or we call it transforming deluded

159
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,440
consciousness into wisdom.

160
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,280
This is the meaning of life.

161
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:59,580
This is what we're trying to do to purify our minds with these wholesome thoughts.

162
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,940
So we say pure mind, pure land.

163
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,640
If we want to go to the pure land, we should always have pure thoughts.

164
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,640
That's the class for today.

165
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,640
Thank you for listening.

166
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,140
Amitabha.

167
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,760
