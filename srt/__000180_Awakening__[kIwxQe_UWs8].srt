1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,800
Today we are going to talk about awakening.

2
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,560
We live our lives not awakened.

3
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,880
We are in a dream state unless we awaken our true self.

4
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,160
There are three truths that we need to know in order to be awakened.

5
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,200
And this truth is in this little quote that we have up here.

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,780
The dharmas arise from conditions.

7
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,060
I affirm that they are empty.

8
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:48,120
They are conventional but yet indicate the meaning of the middle way.

9
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,640
There are three truths that we need to know in order to be awakened.

10
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,640
The first is called emptiness.

11
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:02,760
The second truth is called conventional truth and the third truth is called the middle way

12
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,760
truth.

13
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,760
What does it mean?

14
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,880
How does it apply to our lives?

15
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:13,200
For dharmas arising from conditions, I affirm that they are empty.

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,520
Dharma in Buddhism, we call everything, no matter it's a tree or a mountain or a thought,

17
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,360
we call it the dharma.

18
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,360
Everything is a dharma.

19
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,320
Dharma arises from the conditions.

20
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:33,980
For example, this pen, you see it here today, it has many, many different conditions.

21
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:37,520
Many factors bring this pen here for us to see.

22
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,200
For example, I have to buy it from Walmart for it to get here.

23
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,120
They have to have factories, they have to make it.

24
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:50,480
It's got to have plastics, it's got to have machines to make it and then I buy them and

25
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,480
it gets here.

26
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,520
So there are many, many different conditions.

27
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,640
These conditions are forever changing.

28
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,940
Nothing is for you to control.

29
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:05,180
Nothing has its own essence that's without conditions from all the different environments

30
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,440
and factors.

31
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,240
That's why I affirm you that they are empty.

32
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,100
Empty doesn't mean they don't exist.

33
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:16,680
It means they're forever changing because they're based on conditions.

34
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,980
That includes my body.

35
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,440
I am on this earth right now.

36
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,440
But one day, I'm going to die.

37
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,680
The condition is going to change.

38
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,100
I'm going to be sick.

39
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,580
I'm going to get old and I'm going to die.

40
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,200
So conditions are forever changing.

41
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,200
It's not permanent.

42
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,320
If it's not permanent, we should not be attached to it.

43
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,060
If you're attached to it, you will have suffering.

44
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,060
You will be sad.

45
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,280
When you're sick, you die, you're sad.

46
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,620
But if I accept, I accept everything is forever changing.

47
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,720
When it changes, I can accept.

48
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,380
I will no longer be upset.

49
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,200
So this actually means empty of the self.

50
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,680
So when we say empty, it's not for you to forget about life and don't want to live.

51
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,820
It's for you to know that everything is forever changing.

52
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:12,000
So I accept and I let go of the idea of a permanent self because we are very caught

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,160
up in the idea of me.

54
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,920
This body is me with my life and my car and my mom.

55
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,920
Everything is mine.

56
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,920
But if you know that everything is mine, you can accept it.

57
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,280
You can accept it.

58
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,400
If you know that everything that you think is mine is forever changing, nothing is you.

59
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,400
Nothing is mine.

60
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,400
There's a girl, first time she got her salary.

61
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,460
So she bought a hat for herself and she's so happy.

62
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:38,400
She went home hoping that her mom would praise her about her beautiful new hat.

63
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,160
But her mom was cooking dinner and didn't see her hat.

64
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,800
So she was really sad.

65
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,040
During dinner, her mom was like, what's wrong with you today?

66
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,240
Well, how come you're not happy?

67
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,120
And she said, I bought a new hat.

68
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,120
I bought a new hat.

69
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,120
I bought this hat with my first paycheck, and you didn't even notice.

70
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,440
And you know what the mom said?

71
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,480
Mom said, I got a perm today.

72
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,480
Did you notice?

73
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,640
So everybody is living in your own ego.

74
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,620
It's not a real me.

75
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,000
You think you're the center of the universe?

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,600
No.

77
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,440
We are actually empty in its essence.

78
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,000
So let go of the idea.

79
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Notice me.

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Notice me.

81
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Notice me.

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,160
I'm the center of everything because that's not the truth.

83
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,960
The truth is we are empty in essence.

84
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,720
Except that fact that is called the first real awakening.

85
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:45,040
The second awakening is if they're empty, they will also be conventional.

86
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,680
Conventional means something that you can see.

87
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,400
Even though it's empty in its essence.

88
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,960
But it has its forms.

89
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,360
I have this body.

90
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,900
If it's empty, do I need to eat?

91
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,160
I still need to eat.

92
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,640
Even though in its essence, it's empty.

93
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,060
Do I still need money to live?

94
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,520
I still need money to live.

95
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:11,640
So even though it's empty, but I know I have to live this life with the best I can be.

96
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,400
I still want to make the best out of this life.

97
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,400
Even though it's empty in essence, I still make it perfect.

98
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,400
I still want to live a great life.

99
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:25,660
want to live a great life this is to let go this is to embrace life to be

100
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:31,160
inspired by life to live a beautiful life it's like playing a movie your life

101
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,480
is like a movie do you want to play a good movie or you want to play a movie

102
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,860
that nobody wants to see then you want to play the great movie for yourself

103
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:45,100
before the day you die you gotta have no regrets and live every day to the

104
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:51,460
fullest that's the conventional wisdom so inspire someone with your life

105
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:56,740
there's a little boy he's very very poor he only has a pair of flip-flops

106
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:01,960
he went to the train station one day and he saw this other boy he's very rich and

107
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,420
he has a pair of beautiful leather shoes so the poor boy is looking at that

108
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:11,800
beautiful leather shoes the rich boy and his dad got on the train it was really

109
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,740
crowded some people squished them and one of the

110
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,080
leather shoes was this one one of the leather shoes was a pair of flip-flops

111
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:21,320
shoes fell off on the train station the poor boy sighed he tried to help him so he tried to run

112
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:26,440
run run and catch the train and let him have the shoe so he tried to run but his flip-flop is

113
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:32,600
already like broken so he cannot run very fast and finally he couldn't run anymore so he threw

114
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:38,840
the shoes hoping he would catch it but it bounced off and still got on the train station so the boy

115
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:46,600
on the train saw it and he saw that boy had no shoes he threw his one shoes down so the poor boy

116
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:55,080
will have a pair so we should all live our life to help others to inspire others with your own

117
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:01,560
existence no matter who you are what your present situation is you can be someone great in this

118
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:08,520
conventional life to make inspirational changes for other people so that's the second awakening

119
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:08,840
the second awakening is the second awakening the second awakening is the second awakening

120
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:16,360
the third awakening is if it's empty and it has conventional truth it indicates the meaning of

121
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:24,280
the middle way the middle way says we want to balance the emptiness and the conventional way

122
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:29,560
the emptiness is to let go let go of the ego

123
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:38,520
don't say notice me love others and let go of the idea of self because our self

124
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:48,040
is empty but embrace life conventional truth means be the best you can be like be

125
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:55,640
inspiring to others live life to the fullest so at the end you have no regret and the middle way says

126
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:08,040
let go of the ego but be the best that you can be so it's a balance of the two when you can do that

127
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:15,320
you will have a wonderful life you have no longer any problems when you stay at home

128
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:23,560
and meditate by yourself you are fine you are at peace when you're with a lot of people

129
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:30,920
enjoying the party you are the best you can be no matter where you are or who you're with you are

130
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:37,960
free of any attachment but you are the best that you can be when you can reach this level you reach

131
