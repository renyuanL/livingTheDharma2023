00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,400
Today we are going to talk about 100 Dharma Shastra by Bodhisattva Vasavandhu.

2
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,800
Everything in the world is categorized into 100 dharmas.

3
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,200
We are going to have an overview of these 100 dharmas.

4
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:37,000
It will help us realize the meaning of all dharmas have no self.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:46,800
The 100 dharmas is categorized into 94 conditioned dharmas and 6 unconditioned dharmas.

6
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,800
Conditioned dharma means everything is from cause and effect.

7
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:57,400
It is because of karma rising and ceasing due to cause and conditions.

8
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,800
Everything rises for this reason because they are conditioned.

9
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,800
They are empty in nature.

10
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:12,100
We want to realize the unconditioned dharma which is our true nature, nirvana, the Buddha nature.

11
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,100
It is not due to cause and conditions.

12
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,300
Therefore, it is the real emptiness.

13
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:23,000
It is our goal of cultivation to reach this unconditioned state.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,700
But how do you find the unconditioned state?

15
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,300
You find it in the conditioned states.

16
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:35,700
From this conditioned life, we want to find the unconditioned enlightenment.

17
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,700
Let's look at these 100 dharmas.

18
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,500
Conditioned dharmas consist of four categories.

19
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,100
The first one is the eight mind dharmas,

20
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,500
which are the eight consciousnesses.

21
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:59,200
Our eye consciousness, ear consciousness, nose, tongue, body, the thinking mind consciousness.

22
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:07,300
Manas takes the alaya consciousness as the self and tells the mind how to think.

23
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,000
And we have the alaya consciousness.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,200
That's the entire storehouse that stores all our karmic seeds.

25
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,000
That's how karma comes.

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,800
That's how we come into reality, the physical world.

27
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,800
Eight mind dharmas, that's the basis of all dharmas.

28
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,700
There was a master from Korea in the Qing Dynasty.

29
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,100
He traveled to China.

30
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,400
One night, he was very tired, very thirsty.

31
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,500
He was looking for water.

32
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,600
Finally, he found a little stream of water.

33
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,600
He drank the water and thought how refreshing it was.

34
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,900
He found a little place to sleep in for that night.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,300
When he woke up in the morning, he wanted to go back to the stream and have some more water.

36
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:58,300
When he went back, he saw it's full of animal carcass.

37
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,300
After seeing that, he wanted to throw up.

38
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:06,500
As he was throwing up, he came into full realization.

39
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,300
It's all made from my mind.

40
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,300
Last night, I thought it was the most delicious water.

41
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,300
But because of my eye consciousness,

42
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,200
and my mind consciousness,

43
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,400
now the water is totally different to me.

44
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,200
It's all because of our perception.

45
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,400
Nothing happens except what's happening in our mind.

46
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,600
If you can use your mind, understand the emptiness of it all,

47
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,400
you will come into full enlightenment.

48
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,100
Then we have the 51 dharmas belonging to the mind.

49
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,900
These are the servants to the kings.

50
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,400
The kings cannot have thoughts unless they have the servants.

51
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,900
So we have 51 different types of mental factors made up of our thoughts.

52
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,900
The 51 are in 6 categories.

53
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:07,400
The first one, 5 universally interactive mental factors.

54
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:13,200
Attention, Contact, Feelings, Perception, Deliberation.

55
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,800
Every thought goes through this.

56
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,400
5 mental factors.

57
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,400
Our eyes want to see, that's attention.

58
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,400
Then the eyes will come in contact with sight.

59
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,900
Your eyes will take a look at something.

60
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,400
You will see form, color, and its movement.

61
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,400
Because of this contact, we develop the eye consciousness.

62
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,400
It distinguishes what color we see.

63
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
Do we like it? Do we not like it?

64
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,400
Then we have wholesome and unwholesome thoughts.

65
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,900
Every thought goes through contact.

66
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,400
And then we have feelings, pleasure, or pain.

67
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,400
Then we have perception, deliberation.

68
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,400
It's when we want to take action based on our perception.

69
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:05,900
So every thought goes through these 5 universally interactive mental factors.

70
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,900
Then we have 5 particular states.

71
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,900
They don't happen all the time.

72
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,400
They only happen in particular states.

73
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,400
Intention.

74
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,400
Resolution.

75
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,400
Mindfulness.

76
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,900
Concentration.

77
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,900
And wisdom.

78
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,400
These only happen in certain situations.

79
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,400
Then we have 11 wholesome thoughts.

80
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,400
Good thoughts.

81
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:34,400
Including faith, diligence, non-greed, non-anger, non-ignorance.

82
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,900
We should have a faithful mind.

83
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:42,900
That everything is made from the mind and all dharmas have no self.

84
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,900
Buddha keep telling us it's all condition arising.

85
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,900
And there is no self.

86
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,400
Why do we keep thinking the self is the center of everything?

87
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,400
Because we don't really have faith in what the dharma is teaching us.

88
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,900
So we need to really have faith in the teaching and in our own Buddha nature.

89
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,900
Our mind is the Buddha.

90
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,900
We just need to see beyond the luddha mind.

91
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,900
Then the mind is the enlightenment.

92
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,900
Enlightened mind.

93
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,900
We have 6 primary unwholesome thoughts.

94
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,900
Greed.

95
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,900
Anger.

96
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,900
Ignorance.

97
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,900
Arrogance.

98
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,900
Doubt.

99
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,900
And wrong view.

100
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,900
These are basic fundamental afflictions.

101
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:34,900
Comes with it 20 secondary unwholesome mental factors.

102
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,900
Hatred.

103
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,900
Vengeance.

104
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,900
Vexation.

105
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,900
So there is deeper anger.

106
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,900
Then we have 4 unfit thoughts.

107
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,900
6 mental factors.

108
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,900
They can be wholesome.

109
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,900
They can be unwholesome.

110
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,900
Sleep can be wholesome or unwholesome.

111
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:57,900
If we sleep so we can get up and meditate and work hard then that's wholesome.

112
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:02,900
If we sleep because we are lazy then that's unwholesome.

113
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,900
So it's a unfixed mental factor.

114
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:11,900
This makes up of 51 dharmas belonging to the mind.

115
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,900
They are the mental factors that consist of our thoughts.

116
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:22,900
We need to work with our thoughts and work with our dharmas belonging to the mind.

117
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,900
That's how we can change our destiny and change our mental formation.

118
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,900
Then we have 11 form dharmas.

119
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,900
This is mental.

120
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,900
This is physical.

121
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,900
There are 11 physical dharmas.

122
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,900
They are 5 sense organs.

123
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,900
Eyes.

124
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,900
Ears.

125
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,900
Nose.

126
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,900
Tongue.

127
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:45,900
And body.

128
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,900
Then we have the 6 sense objects.

129
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,900
Eyes sees sight.

130
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,900
Ears with sound.

131
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,900
Nose smells.

132
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,900
Tongue tastes.

133
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,900
Body touch.

134
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,900
And the mind with dharma.

135
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,900
These are our physical world.

136
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,900
They are also made by the mind.

137
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,900
And there is no self.

138
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,900
Mental.

139
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,900
Physical.

140
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,900
All created by the mind.

141
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,900
All illusory.

142
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,900
All conditioned dharma.

143
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,900
All unreal.

144
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:25,900
Also there are 24 dharmas not interactive with the mind.

145
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,900
So they are not mental.

146
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,900
They are not physical.

147
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,900
They are not interactive.

148
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,900
They are made up concepts.

149
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,900
So they are even more fake than the first 3.

150
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,900
There are 24 of them.

151
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,900
I only listed 4.

152
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,900
One is birth.

153
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,900
We have this concept of things come into being.

154
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,900
Such as our lives.

155
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,900
Or I put my palms together.

156
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,900
There is a slit in the middle.

157
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,900
This is cause and conditions.

158
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,900
When I separate them, there is no slit.

159
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,900
Do you think that's real?

160
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,900
That's only temporary.

161
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,900
And it's conditioned dharma.

162
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,900
So there is no real birth.

163
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,900
And there is no aging.

164
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,900
Our hair becomes gray.

165
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,900
And we walk slowly.

166
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,900
These are just conditioned.

167
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,900
Because of our karma stored in the light of consciousness.

168
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,900
The time comes.

169
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,900
We have aging.

170
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,900
But it's not a real existence.

171
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,900
And time is relative.

172
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,900
There is 365 days in a year.

173
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,900
But that's just human made concept.

174
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,900
Only happen in this earth.

175
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,900
So time is unreal.

176
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,900
Direction.

177
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,900
South.

178
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,900
North.

179
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,900
East.

180
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,900
West.

181
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,900
They are just human made concept.

182
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,900
And depending on where you are.

183
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,900
Directions apply differently.

184
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,900
Different conditions.

185
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,900
Different cause.

186
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,900
You have different directions.

187
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,900
They are all relative.

188
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,900
They are all impermanent.

189
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,900
There is not a self in any of these.

190
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:03,900
8 plus 51 plus 11 plus 24.

191
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,900
So 94 conditioned dharmas in this world.

192
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,900
None of it is me.

193
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,900
All dharmas have no self.

194
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,900
Then we have the 6 unconditioned dharmas.

195
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,900
I only listed one.

196
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,900
Which is the most important.

197
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,900
Our true suchness.

198
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,900
Our buddha nature.

199
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,900
Or we can call it nirvana.

200
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,900
This is something without a form.

201
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,900
It's not from cause and conditions.

202
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,900
There is no rising or seizing.

203
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,900
That's just our pure enlightenment.

204
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,900
Our original self.

205
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,900
How do we find the self?

206
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,900
Basically you have to see.

207
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,900
All this is fake.

208
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,900
Your thoughts.

209
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,900
Your physical being.

210
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,900
And all the concepts of the world.

211
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,900
They are human made concepts.

212
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,900
Made by your deluded mind.

213
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,900
They are only other dependent nature.

214
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,900
And do not give rise to the fully conceptualized nature.

215
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:06,900
Then it is the fully accomplished nature.

216
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,900
That's our true suchness.

217
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:14,900
If you can realize how the conditioned life right now is fictional.

218
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:20,900
Then you will come into realization to the unconditioned dharma.

219
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,900
The 8 mind dharmas is called supreme.

220
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,900
Because the mind creates everything.

221
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,900
We need to use our mind to think of good thoughts.

222
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,900
Good thoughts.

223
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:36,900
Master Fo Ying and famous poet Su Dong Po.

224
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,900
They were best friends.

225
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,900
But they like to bicker with each other.

226
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,900
One time they were both meditating.

227
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,900
Su Dong Po asked Fo Ying master.

228
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,900
What do you see near us?

229
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,900
Fo Ying master said.

230
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,900
Oh I see a Buddha.

231
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,900
Then the master asked him.

232
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,900
What do you see in me?

233
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,900
He said.

234
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,900
I see a pile of dung.

235
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,900
He thought he won.

236
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,900
So he went home.

237
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,900
His sister asked him.

238
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,900
Why are you so happy my brother?

239
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,900
He said.

240
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,900
I won today.

241
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,900
So he told her what happened.

242
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,900
She said.

243
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:17,900
He sees in you a mundane person as a Buddha.

244
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:23,900
But you see him an enlightened master as a pile of feces.

245
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,900
You really lose big time.

246
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,900
If we use our mind to think of good thoughts.

247
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,900
We create a beautiful world.

248
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,900
If our mind is full of negativities.

249
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,900
We create hell for ourselves.

250
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,900
That's why it's most supreme.

251
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,900
The 51 dharmas belonging to the mind.

252
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,900
That's interact with the first.

253
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:51,900
The 51 dharmas must interact with the 8 mind dharmas.

254
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,900
Then the 11 form dharmas.

255
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,900
They are shadows.

256
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,900
Manifested by the previous two.

257
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:04,900
Forms are shadows created by the mind dharmas.

258
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,900
And the mental factors.

259
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,900
All the physical world.

260
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,900
They are just shadows.

261
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,900
Manifested by the mind.

262
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:18,900
The 24 dharmas not interactive with the mind.

263
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:25,900
They are separated from the position of the previous three.

264
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,900
They are not the 8 mind dharmas.

265
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,900
They are not the mental factors.

266
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,900
They are not the physical form.

267
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,900
They are separate from the position of the first three.

268
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,900
That's why it's called not interactive with the mind.

269
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,900
Lastly, the unconditioned dharmas.

270
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,900
They are revealed by the previous four.

271
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,900
The unconditioned dharmas.

272
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,900
They are revealed by all the conditioned dharmas.

273
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,900
Which are the first four categories.

274
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,900
So as you can see, they are all related.

275
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,900
They are all non-self.

276
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,900
They are all created by the mind.

277
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,900
And they are all non-existent.

278
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,900
If we can realize that, then that's enlightenment.

279
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,900
That's the class for today.

280
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,900
Thank you for listening.

281
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,900
Amitabha.
