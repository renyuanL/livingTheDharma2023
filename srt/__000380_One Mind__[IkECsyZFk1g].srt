1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,960
Today we are going to talk about One Mind.

2
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:26,140
This is from The Awakening of Faith in Mahayana by Bodhisattva Asvangosha.

3
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:35,780
This is a masterpiece that combines 100 Mahayana sutras into one concise structure.

4
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,020
It talks about our pure mind.

5
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:46,020
In the beginning, he said, may all sentient beings be made to discard all their doubts

6
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:55,060
and to cast aside their evil attachment and to give rise to the correct faith in Mahayana.

7
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:59,440
So the lineage of Buddha may not be broken off.

8
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,300
He wrote this sutra for this reason.

9
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:09,100
He wants us to get rid of all our doubts about our true nature and to cast away our attachment

10
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:15,960
to this deluded mind so we can have true correct faith in our own Buddha nature.

11
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,920
We call it the Mahayana.

12
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,500
We will have a brief overview about this sutra in this class.

13
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,500
First, let's talk about this sutra as a whole.

14
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,520
The One True Mind.

15
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,620
It has two aspects.

16
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,520
One is the aspect of absolute.

17
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,300
Two is the aspect of the phenomena.

18
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,460
This is the suchness, the true mind.

19
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:47,180
This is the life of our mundane that is in samsara.

20
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:53,880
We want to get out of this life and to live in our enlightened mind, the true Buddha nature.

21
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,180
The suchness.

22
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,880
So let's first look at this absolute mind.

23
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,380
It has two aspects.

24
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,520
One is the non-verbal suchness.

25
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,320
Two is verbal suchness.

26
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,640
This suchness, you cannot describe it.

27
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,640
That's why it's non-verbal.

28
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,880
But if you really have to describe it, we can describe it in this way.

29
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,720
Let's first talk about how it's non-verbal.

30
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,720
It transcends all verbalization.

31
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,720
It transcends all verbalization.

32
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,560
Description and conceptualization.

33
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,760
It is what it is, that's why it's called suchness.

34
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:40,120
You can say one world of reality and the essence of all phases of existence in their totality.

35
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,000
Our one mind is the only world.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,420
But we think the physical world we live in is the real world.

37
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,720
But only the world of the mind is the reality.

38
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:59,760
we call it the one world of reality. It's the essence of all different kinds of existence.

39
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:06,500
The ten dharma rounds, there's only one round, the mind of the Buddha, which is our own mind.

40
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:13,680
So all existence in their totality, the whole universe is this mind that cannot be described

41
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:20,880
in words. If we predicate on words, we would call it the verbal suchness. In terms of two

42
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:29,500
aspects, it's truly empty, yet it's truly not empty. It's truly empty because this suchness

43
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:37,280
is empty of all existence. Human beings cannot be enlightened because we have two problems.

44
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,940
First, we think there is a real self. Two, we think everything in the world is real.

45
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:50,820
That's our attachment to the self and attachment to all dharmas, which means all things. The

46
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:50,840
true dharma is the one that is not empty. The true dharma is the one that is not empty.

47
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:50,860
The true dharma is the one that is not empty. The true dharma is the one that is not empty.

48
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:59,700
Truly emptiness is describing suchness is really empty of self and empty of all things.

49
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:07,160
If we can detach from the self and detach from all worldly things, thinking is real,

50
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:14,820
we can be empty of all dharmas. That is the true nature of the absolute mind.

51
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:20,820
If you want to talk about it in its conventional existence, you would say it is truly

52
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:28,060
non-empty as well. It has conventional existence. It's provincial. We still live in this world.

53
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:37,480
So we still need to see how this mind is endowed with numerous excellent qualities. It is eternal,

54
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:45,960
permanent, immutable, pure, and self-sufficient. You can say it is eternal. It doesn't have

55
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,780
rising or ceasing. It lasts forever. It doesn't matter which realm you are in. It doesn't matter

56
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:58,220
how many reincarnations you go through. It is permanent because it is not impermanent

57
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:05,900
like all the conditions arising. Immutable, it is not moved by any life situation. A

58
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:13,300
true mind is not affected like our emotion by all the life circumstances. It is also

59
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:20,480
pure. Never been soiled by any of your human experiences which means it has no se with

60
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:27,320
to begin with is self-sufficient it's always satisfied because innately we are

61
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:33,800
always perfect we're always pure in our goodness so know your goodness you

62
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:39,920
really have this truly non-empty suchness but how come we are not right

63
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:45,080
here all the time right now we still live a mundane life because we living in

64
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,900
the phenomenon world which is the samsara we will talk about what is

65
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:55,840
non-enlightenment and what is enlightenment we have original

66
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:03,860
enlightenment basically is the suchness but our mind become agitated it start

67
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:09,740
moving it becomes non-enlightened we start discriminating with the sense of

68
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:14,900
the self we become deluded then we start learning Buddhism we think

69
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,060
that we are not right we are not right we are not right we are not right we are not right

70
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,120
there's a way out of this non-enlightened mind so we start

71
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,760
cultivating this is called the process of actualization of enlightenment

72
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:31,460
finally at the end we will reach the final enlightenment there are four kinds

73
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:36,540
of enlightenment what is original enlightenment two is non-enlightenment

74
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:41,620
three is process of actualization of enlightenment

75
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,040
lastly is final enlightenment

76
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:50,920
we're using the deluded mind we call it the Alaya consciousness this is the

77
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:56,560
non enlightened mind but we actually have an original enlightened mind and

78
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:03,580
this original enlightened mind it has two aspects one is in relation to defiled

79
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:10,900
state two is pure essence in relation to its defiled state which means we have

80
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:16,900
the ability to overcome all our afflictions and all our defilements

81
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:24,340
because we have purity of wisdom and we actually have super rational functions

82
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:30,980
purity of wisdom that's when we actually have non-conceptual knowledge of all

83
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:36,500
things we can live without discriminating learning Buddhism is to

84
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,880
practice insight meditation so we don't discriminate as much

85
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:47,620
we're awakened we're aware of what's going on without conceptualization that

86
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:54,140
is our purity of wisdom we call it fundamental non-conceptual knowledge

87
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:59,780
that's what we want to reach you live in the state without a lot of

88
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:05,560
conceptualization as when the self would be empty then we have suprarational

89
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,780
functions if we are empty of the self then we will be empty of the

90
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:10,880
damage and then there is no healthy self so if we have a transgenerational

91
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:17,880
Dharma will have the ability to help all other sentient beings to become enlightened. Because

92
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:24,640
we are naturally endowed with excellent qualities. Every day it will be miraculous. You can help

93
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:29,680
a lot of people in your life. Just be there at the right moment, at the right time, tell

94
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:36,900
people the right Dharma and they will be enlightened. Because we have this supernatural power. Only

95
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:44,580
if we have this non-conceptual knowledge. So do not use this thinking mind, but use

96
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:52,680
our true nature to live this life. So the purity of wisdom is called fundamental non-conceptual

97
00:08:52,680 --> 00:09:01,040
knowledge. The suprarational function is called the subsequent non-conceptual knowledge. One

98
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,880
is fundamental, one is subsequent. We have both of these innate in us.

99
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:13,500
But we need to deal with our afflictions in relation to our defiled states. Then this

100
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:20,320
original enlightenment has its pure essence. It is actually described as a perfect round

101
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:28,360
mirror. We turn the whole alaya consciousness, the deluded mind into the great perfect round

102
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:36,560
mirror wisdom. Here it has four kinds of mirrors. One is the mirror empty of images. The mirror

103
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,460
is empty. It is free in essence. The mirror is empty of all the images. First we need

104
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:47,140
to understand all the images in the mirror is empty in essence. Everything is truly empty.

105
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:54,680
The mirror is empty of all marks of appearances. Everything appears in your life. There are

106
00:09:54,680 --> 00:10:01,480
only images in the mirror. A mirror knows not to be attached to whatever that's happening

107
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,320
reflected in the mirror. It stays perfect. Unmoved by the pains and sores of life, it

108
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:06,520
is always an unmoving mirror. It is everywhere. It is always open. It is always healthy, it's

109
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:13,000
happiness and sadness of your life that is the perfect mirror then it's the

110
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,840
mirror influencing toward enlightenment now it's talking about how it's truly

111
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:27,280
not empty all the images in front of mirror is for us to use it's not empty

112
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:34,360
because it influences advancing toward enlightenment you use your life

113
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:40,780
situation to be a bodhisattva and to help others to reach enlightenment this

114
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:47,620
is truly empty this is truly not empty then we have the third mirror mirror

115
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:56,080
free from defiled objects we use the Dharma and this purity of wisdom that's

116
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:02,980
why we are free from hindrance both in our afflictions and in our intellect we

117
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,340
should be free from all of this

118
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:11,360
our defilements of the self and free from our discriminating intellect this

119
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:18,260
is the mirror that is not tainted in any way we use the Dharma to renunciate from

120
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:25,800
samsara by changing our non-enlightened state lastly the mirror influencing one

121
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:32,940
to cultivate goodness so the mirror free from defiled objects that's our purity

122
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,980
of wisdom

123
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:40,520
the mirror influencing one to cultivate goodness that's our suprarational

124
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:46,700
functions now whatever appears in our mirror is helping us and helping

125
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:54,200
everyone to become enlightened to bring out our capacity for goodness we are now

126
00:11:54,200 --> 00:12:00,440
happily living in this world cultivating all the goodness and to help all sentient

127
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,980
beings there's actually no hindrances in your

128
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:04,320
mind there's actually no hindrances in your mind there's actually no hindrances in your mind

129
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:13,060
all the deluded mind has no validity be substantiated the deluded mind never existed

130
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:18,440
in the first place there's a fourth patriarch of Zen Buddhism his name is

131
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:25,540
Dao-Sing when he was 14 years old he visited the third Patriarch Seng Chan when he

132
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:33,780
arrived he asked master please teach me a way to Liberation the master said who is

133
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:40,140
tying you down?" He thought about it for a while. Nobody, nothing is tying me down.

134
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:47,340
Then the master said, why do you need a method of liberation? What do you need to

135
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:54,840
liberate from? At that moment he became fully enlightened at the age of 14. So

136
00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:02,100
who is tying you down? Why are you living a suffering life not enlightened? Because

137
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:07,800
we are caught up in our deluded mind, but we don't have to live this way. Now

138
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:14,500
let's look at non-enlightenment – our non-enlightened state. The deluded mind

139
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:22,880
we're using, it has nine aspects – three subtle aspects and six cruel aspects.

140
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:28,860
The three subtle aspects, that's from our enlightened consciousness. The six claro

141
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,080
aspects is from our sixth consciousness.

142
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:38,200
thinking mind. This is the storage. This is the thinking mind. The storage house, the

143
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:45,580
alaya, we will naturally become agitated. It has three aspects. First is the

144
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:51,960
activity of ignorance. The mind is agitated. It becomes ignorant. That's why

145
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:58,200
it's called activity of ignorance. Then it will develop the second aspect,

146
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:05,080
perceiving subject. Then we will have the third aspect, the world of object. Because

147
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:13,020
our mind is agitated, it starts moving. We create a perceiving mind and we create

148
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:20,820
the world of the object. Both the subject and the object are created by your

149
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:27,120
alaya consciousness. That's why we said everything is an illusion. It's only

150
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,180
created by the mind.

151
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:34,060
By your deluded mind. The world you see and the mind that is interpreting the

152
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:39,700
world, they're all from your own alaya consciousness. Then we will have the

153
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:46,600
three cruel aspects. When we face life situations, we naturally will be defiled.

154
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:52,600
First, we will have a discriminating intellect. For example, someone is

155
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:58,000
yelling at you, insulting you. So your like and dislike will discriminate.

156
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,880
Against the situation. In this case, you dislike someone insulting you.

157
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:11,720
Number two is the aspect of continuity. You will keep thinking about it because this event

158
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:18,880
is giving you pain or pleasure. In this case, it's pain. And you keep thinking about it,

159
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:25,680
you cannot fall asleep. It's really disrupting to your life. The third aspect is the aspect

160
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,160
of attachment.

161
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,660
Now you're super attached to this dislike.

162
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,020
You are very upset.

163
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:36,120
You really dislike the situation.

164
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:42,180
Number four, you will give it aspect of speculation of names and letters.

165
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:49,080
You will assign a label, this person is evil, he's mean, he's my enemy, I hate him.

166
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,340
Now he's attached to this name and label.

167
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:56,740
Number five is the aspect of giving rise to karma.

168
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:00,600
You will talk back or you will hit this person.

169
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,360
You will give rise to bodily actions.

170
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,360
Then that becomes karma.

171
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,200
Lastly, it's the aspect of suffering.

172
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:15,820
Because you produce karma, you will have related suffering based on your anger, malicious words,

173
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,460
or your actions.

174
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:20,400
You will have the negative karma.

175
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,940
Now you have to suffer the consequences of your mind.

176
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:25,940
So every situation, you will have negative karma.

177
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,720
So every situation, you will have negative karma.

178
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,720
So every situation, you will have negative karma.

179
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,200
So every situation, you will have negative karma.

180
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,140
Any situation, we think like this.

181
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,240
Any situation, we think like this.

182
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,940
We go through the three subtle aspects and we go through the six cruel aspects.

183
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,300
We go through the three subtle aspects and we go through the six cruel aspects.

184
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,140
That's why we are always non-enlightened.

185
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:43,180
So what do we do now?

186
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:50,880
It's to catch yourself at the earlier stage of the cruel aspects or even at the subtle

187
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,880
aspects.

188
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,920
Catch yourself early, when you are attaching name, when you're upset and eat comprar.

189
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:02,800
upset when you are having negative thoughts the sooner you catch it the sooner you will be out

190
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:10,800
of samsara every day you become a little more enlightened this is everyday practice everyday

191
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:20,480
cultivation you want to reduce our non-enlightened deluded mind and have our purity of wisdom and

192
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:27,600
suprarational function come out you have to let go of your deluded thoughts your false thinking

193
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:34,720
so the trick is have faith in the mahayana how should i live this life should i keep living this

194
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:42,800
life in the six crew aspect and the three subtle aspects repeat the same pattern of thinking or do

195
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:49,680
i want to get out of samsara i need to change my thinking pattern i need to have non-conceptual

196
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,240
knowledge

197
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:58,160
stop discriminating and start living in the true suchness bodhisattva asangosha

198
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:03,520
explained the absolute aspect and the phenomena aspect

199
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:12,320
they are mutually inclusive they are one of the same you cannot be away from the phenomenon

200
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:19,360
to see the absolute and you cannot live in the absolute without the phenomenon so they are

201
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,480
mutually the same

202
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:28,100
same. We only have one mind that is without any differentiation and it's

203
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:34,580
without any alteration. It is only the existence of the one mind. There was a

204
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:40,920
monk who has been holding precepts for all his life, pure precepts. So one day he

205
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:46,160
was walking on the street at night. All of a sudden he stepped on something, feels

206
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,560
like a live frog. He went home and he could not sleep that night because he

207
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:56,980
thought he broke the precept of no killing. In the morning he woke up, he

208
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:02,240
went to the same spot and looked for the frog. Little did he know, wow it was

209
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:09,860
only a very right eggplant. He realized the world of the object is only created

210
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:16,040
by the mind. Nothing really existed except what is experienced in your own

211
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,140
mind.

212
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:23,440
He realized I have a strong self because I think I am the one holding pure

213
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:30,020
precept and he has strong attachment to the Dharma because he thinks holding

214
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:36,020
precept is the most important thing. So he did not understand the empty of the

215
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:43,460
self and empty of all Dharma. We need to really awaken our faith in our true

216
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,040
suchness.

217
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:54,140
When Gosha wrote this shastra, it's so that all sentient beings would be free from

218
00:19:54,140 --> 00:20:02,220
suffering of their deluded mind and to reach ultimate bliss. We can all get out of

219
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:11,680
samsara and reach enlightenment and be aligned with our suchness. So samsara or

220
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,920
nirvana, you get to choose.

221
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,920
So that's the class for today. Thank you.

222
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,920
Thank you for listening. Amitabha.
