1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,520
Today we are going to talk about repentance.

2
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:25,160
Why is it so hard for us to change our bad habits and defilements such as quitting smoking,

3
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:31,000
stop arguing with our spouses, stop being bitter, jealous, and angry?

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,920
It's because we haven't learned how to truly repent.

5
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:41,780
So today we are going to discuss how to repent and reform and effectively change our lives

6
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,780
for the better.

7
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,680
So there are two kinds of repentance.

8
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:52,080
One is called formal repentance and the second one is called formless repentance.

9
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,080
Formal repentance.

10
00:00:53,080 --> 00:01:00,760
Of all bad karma which I have done based on beginningless grief, anger, and ignorance

11
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:06,820
committed by body, speech, and mind, I now repent and reform.

12
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:14,620
We need to admit that we have a lot of bad karma, which means we have a lot of bad causes

13
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:18,940
which will have negative retributions in the future.

14
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,920
So recognize and admit that we have a lot of mistakes.

15
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,840
We have done a lot of bad things.

16
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,960
The mistakes are based on beginningless grief, anger, and ignorance.

17
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,560
They're all from our three poisons of the mind.

18
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,340
It's beginningless because we have lifetimes and lifetimes deeply ingrained poisons inside

19
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,340
of us.

20
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:47,600
We commit a lot of bad deeds from our body, speech, and mind.

21
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,420
These are the three gateways of our actions.

22
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,640
We have ten unwholesome deeds.

23
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,780
If we don't do these ten things, then it's ten wholesome deeds.

24
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,640
That's how we judge good and evil.

25
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:08,180
Three are from the body, four are from our speech, and three are from our mind.

26
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:13,040
First we have killing, which means harming others' lives.

27
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,460
And the second is stealing, taking other people's belongings when it doesn't belong to you.

28
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,100
Third is sexual misconduct.

29
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:21,780
Adultery.

30
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,400
Fourth is lying, deceiving others.

31
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,480
All the bad deeds are not benefiting others.

32
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:36,540
The fifth is divisive speech, breaking up people's relationships by slandering another

33
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,540
person.

34
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:42,280
The sixth is harsh speech, which means all kinds of harsh language.

35
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,740
Idle gossip is unwholesome jokes or have sexual connotations.

36
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,320
And from our mind, there's greed, selfish.

37
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,320
We only think of others.

38
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,320
We only think of ourselves.

39
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:50,360
We only think of others.

40
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,320
We only think about ourselves.

41
00:02:52,320 --> 00:03:00,860
Anger, ill feeling, animosity toward others, and we have ignorance, not understanding cause

42
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,860
and effect.

43
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:08,280
Don't understand karma, that's why we're worried, angry, we have a lot of anxiety and

44
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,280
stress about life.

45
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,280
That's all from our ignorance.

46
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,980
That's why our bad karmas are committed by body, speech, and mind.

47
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,420
I now repent and reform.

48
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,620
From today on.

49
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:27,540
I vow to repent, turn around completely, never do it again.

50
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,380
So the key of repentance is never do the offenses again.

51
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:39,100
Because we are human, we're not born a saint, we all make mistakes, we're not perfect.

52
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:47,000
So a lot of times, a cultivator will repent, make the offenses, and then repent again and

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
make the offenses.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,380
According to the Bodhisattva precepts, we're not perfect.

55
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,380
We're not perfect.

56
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:57,160
As long as you keep trying, you have the heart of confession, but it's just that the offenses

57
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,840
are just too deeply ingrained that you cannot change it right away, you don't break the

58
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,840
precept.

59
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,940
It actually has merit just for trying.

60
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,700
So precepts are very, very sympathetic and very, very flexible.

61
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:16,620
As long as we hold the precept and we remember to change and to confess, we are already on

62
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,100
our way to Buddhahood.

63
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,300
And we're accumulating infinite merit.

64
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,300
And we're accumulating infinite merit.

65
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,240
And we're accumulating infinite merit just by struggling to do good.

66
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,140
The key is never give up.

67
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:31,960
I might not be perfect right now, but I will keep trying every day until I have no more

68
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,040
offenses.

69
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,040
So that's the spirit of a Bodhisattva.

70
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,680
At Buddha's time, there was a Angulimala.

71
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,740
He was the son of a Brahmin.

72
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,840
He was sent to study with his teacher at a young age.

73
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,840
Because he's very smart, he was the teacher's favorite student.

74
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,840
And all the other students were very good students.

75
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,500
And all the other students were jealous of him.

76
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:59,300
So they told the teacher that Angulimala is having a relationship with the teacher's wife.

77
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,220
The teacher was very upset and wanted to revenge.

78
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:10,300
So he told Angulimala, you need to kill a thousand people and give me their fingers

79
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,500
as a payment for me teaching you.

80
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,820
Angulimala was confused.

81
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,600
But he started killing people all over the villages.

82
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
And he put a lot of money into it.

83
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,780
He put the fingers on the necklace and wrapped it around his neck.

84
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:28,240
So by this time, he already had 999 fingers.

85
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,240
He just needed one more.

86
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,920
He said to himself, I'm going to kill the first person that I see and then I will be

87
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,920
done.

88
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,660
The first person that came was his mother.

89
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,340
And he said, okay, I'm going to kill my mother.

90
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,960
This other side, there was a monk, which is Buddha.

91
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,600
And he said, okay, I will kill this monk.

92
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,600
He started running toward the monk, trying to catch him.

93
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,560
But no matter how hard he tried, he could not catch up to this monk, who was walking

94
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,560
very slowly.

95
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,480
He was exhausted.

96
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,920
He cried out, you stop now.

97
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,920
Buddha turned back and said, I have stopped.

98
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,880
It is you that have not stopped.

99
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,600
Angulimala was confused.

100
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,940
He's like, what do you mean, monk?

101
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:15,720
I have stopped and you are still walking, but you said the opposite.

102
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,960
Buddha said, I have stopped all my anger.

103
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:26,740
Anger and violence, long time ago, but you are still killing and hurting people.

104
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,120
You need to stop now.

105
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,160
Just these few words touched the heart of Angulimala.

106
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,020
He kneeled down, confessed that he was wrong.

107
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,900
He asked to be ordained as a monk.

108
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,380
From that day on, he cultivated extremely hard.

109
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:48,800
No matter how other people treated him, throwing rocks at him.

110
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,700
Because he's a mass murderer, he has no ill feeling toward anyone anymore.

111
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,420
His heart is always at peace and always cultivating.

112
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:03,760
One day he saw a pregnant lady having a hard time giving birth.

113
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:08,180
He went back to the temple and asked Buddha, how can I help this lady?

114
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,960
Buddha told him what to do.

115
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:17,580
So he came back and very sincerely said, sister, from the day that I have been a monk till

116
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,580
now.

117
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:23,340
I have never had any ill feeling toward any living being.

118
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,160
By this truth, may you be well.

119
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,100
May your unborn baby be well.

120
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:36,580
Immediately the mother gave birth and both the mother and the child are safe and healthy.

121
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:45,520
So from a mass murderer that killed 999 people to the most compassionate person and became

122
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,580
our head and enlightened.

123
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,580
How is that possible?

124
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:52,400
If he can do it, we can do it.

125
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,260
We haven't done anything that bad.

126
00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:02,080
We can be a noble and virtuous person if we just keep trying, holding precepts and keep

127
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,960
repenting every day.

128
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,520
It's like washing ourselves clean.

129
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:12,440
Repentance is a gift for us to renew and becoming better and better each day.

130
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,340
So love to repent.

131
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,340
It's a great dharma door for us to improve.

132
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:21,240
The second one is called formless repentance.

133
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:27,920
So formal repentance is changing actual offenses through the behavior.

134
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:33,300
Formless repentance is changing from the mind, from the source.

135
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,560
Offenses arise from the mind, use the mind to repent.

136
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,780
When the mind is forgotten, offenses are no more.

137
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,360
Mind forgotten, offenses eradicated.

138
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,960
Both are empty.

139
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:51,960
This is called true repentance and reform.

140
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,140
This is a deeper wisdom.

141
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,760
Offenses arise from the mind.

142
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:03,080
The root of all our offenses comes from the mind.

143
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,960
It's like we have a poisonous tree.

144
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,200
We don't want to just pull the leaves one by one.

145
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,640
We want to uproot the whole tree.

146
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,860
So we want to know our mind and use the mind to repent.

147
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,860
Then we will have no more offenses.

148
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:22,860
When the mind is forgotten, offenses are no more.

149
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,860
The key here is when the mind is forgotten.

150
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,860
It doesn't mean we become forgetful.

151
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,860
It means we get to the deep depth of our mind.

152
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:42,860
The depth of our mind is without thinking of the duality of good and evil, wholesome and unwholesome.

153
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,860
There's no offenses.

154
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,860
There's no merits.

155
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,860
It's all the same.

156
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,860
Because in essence, it's all empty.

157
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:55,860
The self is empty and all the offenses are empty.

158
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,860
When you understand this truth, your mind is pure.

159
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:03,860
You will have no more offenses to start with.

160
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,860
So offenses are no more.

161
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:12,860
The mind forgotten, offenses eradicated, both are empty.

162
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:19,860
The mind is empty of its essence and offenses are empty in its essence.

163
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,860
Both are empty so they don't really exist.

164
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:29,860
If I ask you, show me the heart when you were angry at someone, it's already gone.

165
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,860
So which one is the real you?

166
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,860
Where is the offenses?

167
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,860
Where is the bad deed?

168
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,860
Where is the mind that committed the offenses?

169
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,860
It's all a conditioned existence.

170
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,860
They're impermanent and it's not real.

171
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:50,860
So know that for a fact, you will be free to change anything because anything is possible.

172
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,860
With emptiness, you can change anything.

173
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:58,860
There's not a set personality or I'm just this, I'm just an alcoholic.

174
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,860
There's nothing that's permanent.

175
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:07,860
Everything is empty of its essence so everything can be changed easily.

176
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,860
This is called true repentance.

177
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,860
Repentance and reform.

178
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,860
This is the wisdom of emptiness.

179
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:25,860
So by understanding this, you will be pure in your mind and you will feel joyous in your heart.

180
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:35,860
No more feeling ashamed or dwelling on your past mistakes, the people that you have hurt or whoever that has hurt you.

181
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,860
Let go of all the trauma and all the things that happened to you.

182
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,860
Because they're empty in its essence.

183
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,860
That's why we meditate.

184
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:54,860
When we meditate, we try to get to the root of the subconscious mind, completely overhaul and change your entire life.

185
00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:00,860
So we need to use both the formal and formless repentance together.

186
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:05,860
Every day we want to repent because repenting means we're getting better.

187
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,860
We're aware of our body, speech and mind.

188
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:14,860
So we need to do the formal repentance and try to change each offenses.

189
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,860
Notice your speech.

190
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,860
Notice your action.

191
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,860
Notice your thoughts.

192
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,860
Change them one by one.

193
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,860
Do not give up.

194
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:27,860
Know that just by trying, you're already earning incredible merits for yourself.

195
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,860
You're on the way to Buddhahood.

196
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:34,860
We also need to keep the formless repentance in mind.

197
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,860
Know that there's no offenses to begin with.

198
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,860
Start with zero.

199
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,860
Every day you're starting anew.

200
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,860
Every day you're starting pure.

201
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,860
Have faith in yourself.

202
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,860
And manifest greatness and happiness.

203
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,860
So that's the class for today.

204
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,860
Thank you for listening.

205
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,860
Amitabha.
