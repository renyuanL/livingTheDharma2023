1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,960
Today we will be talking about Tranquility and Insight Meditation.

2
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,960
Tranquility is about the calmness of our mind and Insight is about the clarity of our mind.

3
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,960
In other words, one is concentration, one is wisdom.

4
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,960
We need both of these in order to become enlightened.

5
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,960
Like two wings of a bird, they are complementary and inseparable.

6
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:42,960
Today we will be learning about five Tranquility Meditations and three corresponding Insight Meditations.

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,960
The first Tranquility Meditation is contact the mind with an object.

8
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:54,960
Our mind is forever busy thinking, so we need to give it something to focus on, a designated object.

9
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,960
For example, your breathing or the name Amitabha.

10
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,960
When you focus on your breathing, you can focus your attention on the tip of your nose,

11
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,960
or you can focus on this area between your nose and your mouth, this free space here.

12
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,960
Feel the air in and out of the space.

13
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,960
That way you can go into a deep concentration.

14
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,960
Some people say, I cannot find my breath, so what do I do?

15
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,960
It's very easy. The trick is not to chase after your breathing.

16
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,960
The trick is to relax, stay put, and let your breathing come loose.

17
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,960
It's very easy.

18
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,960
The second Tranquility Meditation is looking for you.

19
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,960
And sure enough, it would be easy and effortless.

20
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:42,960
So have a gentle, simple, calm, and beautiful mind, and meditation would be natural and easy.

21
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,960
So this is like keeping a wild monkey under lock.

22
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,960
Our mind is like a wild monkey.

23
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,960
It's forever busy jumping around thinking.

24
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,960
So we need to lock it with our breathing or lock it with the name Amitabha.

25
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,960
The third one is stop the mind from following scattered thoughts.

26
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,960
Even if you have a designated object of meditation, it will still run around.

27
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,960
So the monkey is wild. It's not that good.

28
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,960
So what you need to do is to do the second meditation is to observe your mind.

29
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,960
Have the ability to be mindful of your thoughts.

30
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,960
We have this habitual continuous thinking.

31
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,960
We need to break this chain, break this habit of scattered thoughts.

32
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,960
Be aware of it. Let go of the thought.

33
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,960
Focus back on your breathing and on your object of meditation.

34
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,960
So this requires intense training.

35
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,960
Training every day is like shooting arrows.

36
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,960
When you have intense training and you work hard every day, you'll be able to shoot the bull's eye.

37
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,960
So we need to learn how to master our mind.

38
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,960
Our mind is a master of our five senses.

39
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,960
Our eyes, our ears, our nose, our tongue, our body.

40
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,960
The mind is the master of the five organs.

41
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,960
When we control our mind, let it come back in and stay with our quiet mind,

42
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:07,960
then we will no longer be outside all the time, clinging onto the world.

43
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,960
So learn to master your mind by stopping shattering thoughts

44
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,960
and focus on your breathing, on your object of meditation.

45
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,960
Number three is cessation of the true essence of reality.

46
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,960
The first two are techniques.

47
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,960
Three, four, five are the theories behind the techniques.

48
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:33,960
Number three is to stop your mind on the reality of things, which is emptiness.

49
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,960
Everything is conditioned existence.

50
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,960
Therefore, they don't have the essence.

51
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,960
They are empty of a controlling self.

52
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:46,960
Everything in your life right now, they are borrowed from conditions.

53
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,960
Your husband, your children, your career, your money, your car.

54
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,960
Everything is borrowed from conditions.

55
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,960
It means your karma, your good and bad karma.

56
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,960
Everything is borrowed.

57
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,960
When everything is borrowed, that means you don't own anything.

58
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,960
You don't have possession of anything.

59
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,960
It's only a temporary existence.

60
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,960
So realize this emptiness.

61
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,960
This emptiness is great.

62
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,960
It will free you from the concept of an ego and a self.

63
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,960
If you ever think about it,

64
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:22,960
and a lot of us, we use our children as our tool to confront ourselves.

65
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,960
If our kids are doing great and doing great,

66
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,960
and doing very well,

67
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,960
we are very proud because we are great parents.

68
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,960
Or our husband or spouse loves us a lot.

69
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,960
We feel worthy of love.

70
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,960
Or we have a lot of money.

71
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,960
Or we have success.

72
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,960
We confront and nourish our ego.

73
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,960
But we actually don't need these things to confront the ego.

74
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,960
Because the ego itself is an illusion.

75
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,960
We don't have a perceived self.

76
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,960
So emptiness means empty of a self,

77
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,960
of an ego that we are grabbing onto.

78
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,960
So be detached from everything.

79
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,960
Know that it's all conditioned existence.

80
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,960
And it doesn't really affect your true existence,

81
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,960
your true self.

82
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,960
This is a great meditation for us to do.

83
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,960
And the related inside meditation is in red.

84
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,960
So it's a contemplation of emptiness.

85
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,960
So it's basically the same thing.

86
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,960
But cessation is more about stopping,

87
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,960
calming the mind of all the wandering thoughts.

88
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,960
Contemplation is more about gaining wisdom.

89
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,960
So it's a different focus.

90
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,960
But the theory is the same.

91
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,960
We need to do both of these.

92
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,960
If you keep focusing on emptiness,

93
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,960
not just doing meditation,

94
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,960
but through every day of your life,

95
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,960
think of your life.

96
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,960
Know that this is a dream.

97
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,960
Then you will no longer be so attached.

98
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,960
You will no longer have so much love and hate

99
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,960
and so caught up with the happiness and the pain.

100
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,960
It's all just a conditioned existence.

101
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,960
Focus back on your meditation.

102
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,960
By doing this,

103
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,960
you're breaking the chain of samsara.

104
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,960
You're breaking the chain of reincarnation.

105
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,960
When we have the self and the ego,

106
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,960
and we're following everything that's going on in the world,

107
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,960
we are following the current of samsara,

108
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,960
of reincarnation.

109
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,960
But if we think about emptiness,

110
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,960
focus on non-self and conditioned existence,

111
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,960
we are swimming against the current of samsara.

112
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,960
So just focusing on this for ten minutes and five minutes,

113
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,960
you are ending samsara.

114
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,960
It's great that we have this wisdom

115
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,960
and Buddha taught this to us.

116
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,960
So always focus and see the world in this light.

117
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,960
See the world as a dream.

118
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,960
See the world as non-existing essence.

119
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,960
That's the key of wisdom of living.

120
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,960
Number four is

121
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,960
cessation on the expedient means

122
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,960
in accordance with conditioned.

123
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,960
So four is opposite of three.

124
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,960
Not focusing so much on the emptiness,

125
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,960
but focusing on all the conditioned existence.

126
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,960
Even though the true nature,

127
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,960
the essence is empty,

128
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,960
but it still has a temporary existence.

129
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,960
Everybody in your life right now,

130
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,960
they are still here.

131
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,960
And their suffering is still real.

132
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,960
So a bodhisattva,

133
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,960
use the conditioned existence

134
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,960
as expedient means

135
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,960
to nourish and boost your compassion,

136
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,960
to really cultivate

137
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,960
and to love everyone

138
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,960
and contribute to the world.

139
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,960
For example, right now our conditioned is

140
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,960
we have the coronavirus on this earth right now.

141
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,960
So what you can do is use this conditioned

142
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,960
to bring out your compassion

143
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,960
when you meditate.

144
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,960
This is actually go with the contact meditation.

145
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,960
So you contact with the object of the visualization.

146
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,960
Basically in your meditation,

147
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,960
you visualize sincerely

148
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,960
that every human being is free from coronavirus

149
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,960
and everybody has happiness,

150
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,960
health and safety.

151
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,960
So if you keep visualizing on it,

152
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,960
it will become reality.

153
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,960
The power of our mind is amazing.

154
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,960
Even though everything is empty,

155
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,960
but the power of our mind can create miracles.

156
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,960
Our mind, our thoughts create reality.

157
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,960
So do positive thinking.

158
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,960
Do visualization.

159
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,960
This is not the ultimate me,

160
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,960
but this is the expedient me.

161
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,960
So use our conditioned wisely

162
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,960
to really bring out our compassion,

163
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,960
our great vow and our diligence.

164
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,960
So the corresponding inside meditation

165
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:39,960
is called contemplation of unreal existence.

166
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,960
The key is existence.

167
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,960
Even though everything is unreal,

168
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,960
but they do exist right now.

169
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,960
So you can think of

170
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,960
a lot of things to help you

171
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,960
with your cultivation.

172
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,960
You can even visualize Amitabha Buddha,

173
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,960
his light shining upon everyone.

174
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,960
And you can even visualize the Pure Land,

175
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,960
how it has the palm of seven jewels

176
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,960
with the water of eight merits.

177
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,960
You can use your mind to make miracles come true.

178
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,960
The more vividly you think about this meditation,

179
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,960
the more it will come alive.

180
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,960
It will become reality.

181
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,960
Believe in the power of your mind

182
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,960
and use and borrow the conditions right now

183
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,960
to boost your vibration

184
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,960
and you can contribute to the world.

185
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,960
Number five is cessation

186
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,960
that avoids two extremes

187
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,960
and develop the right insight on the middle way.

188
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,960
So it's now the balance of three and four.

189
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,960
So we stop our mind,

190
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,960
we quiet our mind

191
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,960
by avoiding the two extremes.

192
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,960
The emptiness and the conditioned existence

193
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,960
So some people are too extreme into the emptiness.

194
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,960
This is more like the Theravada Buddhist

195
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,960
because it's so much about emptiness,

196
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,960
impermanence and suffering.

197
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,960
We might be very empathetic about the world.

198
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,960
We might not have the great compassion

199
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,960
to save all sentient beings.

200
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,960
So that's one extreme.

201
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,960
The other extreme is Bodhisattvas.

202
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,960
They're too involved in saving everybody

203
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,960
in this current condition

204
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,960
and they're too caught up

205
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,960
and they have no more wisdom.

206
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,960
So both of these extremes are not good.

207
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,960
We want to avoid them

208
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,960
and develop the right insight

209
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,960
which is without the two extremes

210
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,960
but recognize the inside of emptiness

211
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,960
and the inside of conventional existence.

212
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,960
Then that's the middle way.

213
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,960
When you're able to balance the two,

214
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,960
that's great wisdom.

215
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,960
And that's how Buddha thinks.

216
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,960
So think from the perspective of Buddha.

217
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,960
That's how Buddha sees the world.

218
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,960
Buddha sees the middle way.

219
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,960
So Buddha is able to

220
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,960
accord with all conditions

221
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,960
but never change,

222
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,960
remain steadfast

223
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,960
while according with all conditions.

224
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,960
So don't you want to be just like Buddha?

225
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,960
And we can all do it

226
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,960
because we all inherit

227
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,960
with the middle way,

228
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,960
with the suchness,

229
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,960
with our true mind

230
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,960
and our true essence.

231
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,960
So number five is actually

232
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,960
stopping the mind meditation

233
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,960
because you want to stop the mind

234
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,960
from going to the two extremes.

235
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,960
The two extremes are now

236
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,960
the scattered thoughts.

237
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,960
You don't want to be too empty

238
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,960
and you don't want to be too caught up

239
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,960
in the worldly existence.

240
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,960
The related inside meditation

241
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,960
is called contemplation of the means.

242
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,960
Always stay with the middle way.

243
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,960
Always stay with balance

244
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,960
of the inside emptiness

245
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,960
and conventional existence.

246
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,960
So that's how Buddha thinks.

247
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,960
That's how we should be thinking.

248
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,960
So we should reside in this mentality

249
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,960
at all times.

250
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,960
In conclusion,

251
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,960
tranquility and inside meditation

252
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,960
is already inherited in our true mind,

253
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,960
our true self.

254
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,960
Our mind is both cohesed

255
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,960
and yet ever shining with awareness.

256
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,960
Both shining with awareness

257
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,960
and yet ever cohesed.

258
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,960
So our mind is cohesed

259
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,960
that means it has tranquility.

260
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,960
It's quiet and calm and all move

261
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,960
but it's ever shining with awareness.

262
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,960
It can see everything clearly.

263
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,960
You can think of yourself like a mirror.

264
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,960
Reflect everything clearly.

265
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,960
Everything that's happening in your life

266
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,960
is the image in the mirror

267
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,960
but it doesn't affect you.

268
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,960
All the love and hate,

269
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,960
happiness and sorrow in the mirror

270
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,960
is just going on conditionally.

271
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,960
You do your best

272
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,960
but you're the mirror

273
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,960
that's not affected by what's going on

274
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,960
in the image,

275
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,960
in the reflection.

276
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,960
Live in this mentality

277
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,960
that is how Buddha thinks.

278
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,960
And if you chant Amitabha Buddha's name

279
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,960
and recite in this mentality

280
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,960
then that's the true Buddha remembrance Samadhi.

281
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,960
The goal of our Pure Land practice.

282
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,960
So that's the class for today.

283
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,960
Thank you for listening.

284
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,960
Amitabha.
