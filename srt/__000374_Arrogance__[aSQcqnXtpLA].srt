1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,100
Today we are going to talk about arrogance.

2
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,160
This is one of the six primary unwholesome mental factors.

3
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,160
We will delve deep into different kinds of arrogance.

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:33,560
There are seven kinds of arrogance and three out of the seven have nine subgroups.

5
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,720
We will talk about them in detail.

6
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,920
First, let's talk about the seven arrogance.

7
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,380
The first one is the general arrogance.

8
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,700
There are two types.

9
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:54,200
One is someone is inferior to us in some qualities such as intelligence, wealth, status or appearance.

10
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,480
We might look down on others who we think are inferior to us.

11
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,420
The second type is we think others are equal to us, so they are not better than we are,

12
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,960
therefore we don't need to respect them or learn from them.

13
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,100
That's the general arrogance.

14
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,260
The second type is called the exaggerated arrogance.

15
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,520
This is worse than the general arrogance.

16
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,200
There are also two types.

17
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,600
One is someone is better than we are, but we treat them as equal.

18
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,100
The second type is someone is equal to us, but we think we are better than we are.

19
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,420
Both of these are exaggerated arrogance.

20
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,980
The third type is outrageous arrogance.

21
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:39,220
It's even worse than exaggerated arrogance.

22
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:45,780
When others are much better than we are, but we think we are much better than they are.

23
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,880
So we are kind of very confused.

24
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,960
So this is called outrageous arrogance.

25
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,580
The first three are different levels of arrogance.

26
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,960
The fourth one is called egotistical arrogance.

27
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,140
This is when we are full of the self and things that are belonging to me, they are always

28
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,140
better.

29
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,400
For example, my son is doing better than yours.

30
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:14,960
My husband is a doctor, is a lawyer, doing much better than you are, or my car, my house.

31
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:22,500
We have the possessive nature, thinking anything that belongs to us is much better because

32
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,500
of the strong self.

33
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,820
Buddha teaches us to get rid of the self.

34
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,820
We call it non-self.

35
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:37,520
The five aggregates are our body, our feelings, our perception, our mental formation, and

36
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,520
our consciousness.

37
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,960
Body and mind, none of it is me or mine.

38
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:51,640
It's only a delusion, thinking these things belong to me, and it's in my possession, and

39
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,280
they are better than others.

40
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,520
The concept of the self, we call it a strong ignorance.

41
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:07,120
So the key to let go of our sense of self is to contemplate on condition arising.

42
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,960
Everything you see in your life is only condition arising.

43
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:19,520
Because of your karma stored in your liar consciousness, you have the cause, the condition,

44
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,520
the results.

45
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,560
That is all.

46
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,520
In this condition, there is no self.

47
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,760
In this condition arising, the nature is emptiness.

48
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,900
None of it is real, it's only condition arising.

49
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,340
In the condition, the intrinsic nature is emptiness.

50
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,760
So nothing belongs to you.

51
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,700
It's only condition.

52
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,960
We need to contemplate on this.

53
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,960
That's what we call insight meditation, or non-self contemplation.

54
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,760
Five, exceeding arrogance.

55
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:57,200
This is for cultivators who are conceited, thinking they have achieved levels that they

56
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,880
have not achieved.

57
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:06,140
Because we have concentration, or we have deep meditation skills, we think we are already

58
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,140
enlightened.

59
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,140
But concentration doesn't mean enlightenment.

60
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,000
Some people might think, oh, I'm already an arhat.

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
In fact, they have not attained the level.

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,040
Six, modest arrogance.

63
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,800
This is when people appear as if they are very humble.

64
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,200
In front of you, they might say, oh, you are so much better, oh, you are so great.

65
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,100
But deep down inside, they just think, you are better, so what?

66
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,260
You just have better luck, or you have more time to study.

67
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,760
If I study, I can be as good as you are.

68
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:44,320
So they know you are better, and they might appear humble, but inside, it's full of arrogance.

69
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,160
So it's very subtle and hard to detect.

70
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,160
Seven.

71
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,300
It's distorted arrogance.

72
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,420
It's when you do bad deeds, you think it's good.

73
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,420
You're proud of yourself.

74
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:59,640
Like, oh, I can drink a lot of alcohol, or I'm cheating, but nobody knows.

75
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,240
That is called distorted or evil arrogance.

76
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,460
You are proud of your bad deeds.

77
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:09,620
So these are the seven general types of arrogance.

78
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,680
Out of these seven, three are very common.

79
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,920
General arrogance, exaggerated arrogance, and modest arrogance.

80
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,920
These are the seven.

81
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,060
These three are most common.

82
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,680
Out of these three, we have nine subgroups.

83
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,980
Out of the general arrogance, we can have these three.

84
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,800
One is I am equal to others.

85
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,040
Since we are equal, I don't need to respect them.

86
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:40,180
Or you might think, my colleagues, we pretty much have the same skills, but how come they

87
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,620
have higher salary than me?

88
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,060
You don't think it's fair, because you have a sense of arrogance.

89
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,140
Number two is utter arrogance.

90
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:47,860
Number three is self-discipline.

91
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:55,060
This is from the point of view of I, this is from the point of view of the others.

92
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,160
They are equal to me, since we're equal.

93
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,320
I do not need to respect them.

94
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,080
I don't need to learn from them.

95
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,860
They have nothing for me to learn.

96
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,860
We are the same.

97
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,360
Even out of equality, you are arrogant.

98
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,420
Number three, there is no one superior to me.

99
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:17,080
Because of this perceived equality, we don't think anybody is higher than us.

100
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,320
Nobody you should learn from, because you are already very good.

101
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,320
We are all equal.

102
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,060
We are pretty much the same.

103
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:29,220
That is our general arrogance out of the perceived equality.

104
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,680
Number two, exaggerated arrogance.

105
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,880
There are also three types.

106
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:39,880
One from the point of view of I, one is the others, and one is everyone.

107
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,640
So I am superior to others.

108
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,280
Now we think we are superior.

109
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,280
Not just equal.

110
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,380
We think we are superior.

111
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,180
This can be someone that's very obvious.

112
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,180
Like I'm the president.

113
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,820
I'm the CEO of the company.

114
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:02,860
Of course you think you are superior than the janitor or any of the lower employees.

115
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:08,660
Usually it's because of our status, our wealth, or we're very intelligent.

116
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:14,220
Out of all these things, we think we are much more superior than others.

117
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,520
Number five is others are inferior.

118
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,020
Others are inferior to me.

119
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,900
So it's saying the same thing, but I'm superior.

120
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,540
They are inferior.

121
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,180
They are below me.

122
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,920
I am higher.

123
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,620
That's when you would think you have the authority to order people around.

124
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,800
There's a Buddhist disciple.

125
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,260
His name is Pellantabhasa.

126
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,820
He was a chief arhat.

127
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,880
So he has supernatural ability.

128
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,820
One time he wanted to cross a river.

129
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:49,920
So he ordered the river god, little slave, stop the current.

130
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,980
I need to cross the stream.

131
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:55,140
The river god was very upset.

132
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,480
How can you call me a little slave?

133
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,760
This arhat did it many times.

134
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,760
Not just this one time.

135
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,140
Finally, the river god, she was very upset.

136
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:11,340
She went to Buddha and complained, Buddha, your disciple, he belittled me.

137
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,420
He called me little slave.

138
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,420
Buddha.

139
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:22,580
Buddha says, if you order this arhat, you apologize to her.

140
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:27,220
Pellantabhasa said, hey, little slave, I'm sorry.

141
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:33,900
So even when he apologized to her, he is being arrogant.

142
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,900
Why?

143
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:39,700
Buddha says, for 500 lifetimes you were his servant.

144
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,100
That's why he's used to it.

145
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,100
He is an arhat.

146
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,100
He doesn't have the affliction.

147
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:52,500
belittle you it's just his residual habits we cannot blame him so we have very deep arrogance

148
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:59,780
that we haven't detect so we need to really contemplate and to know our arrogance six

149
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:07,460
there's no one equal to me it's saying the same thing i am superior others are inferior

150
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:14,340
there's no one equal to me they are all exaggerated arrogance because we think we're

151
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:21,940
much higher than others no one can be equal to us because we're superior that's why we cannot

152
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:29,620
respect anyone now let's look at modest arrogance and we pretend to be humble but deep down inside

153
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:37,300
we're not there are also three kinds i am inferior to others i admit i am not

154
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:44,100
as good as they are but only by a little bit because i'm not that bad they think they're

155
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:53,780
inferior only by a little but in fact it's a lot number eight others are superior to me i admit

156
00:09:53,780 --> 00:10:02,020
they are superior to me but only slightly just a little bit just because i didn't have the chance

157
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:07,380
i didn't have the time that's why i cannot be as good as they are but if i do i

158
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:15,700
can be just as good so deep down inside is still full of arrogance and number nine there is no one

159
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:25,620
inferior to me i admit they are much better than i am i'm no good but so what i don't care so this is

160
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:32,820
the type of person they don't care they admit they are not good but they don't give a care they just

161
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:37,140
let it all go but that is still arrogance so our

162
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:45,620
arrogance they are all these different types this all comes from number four it's the basis

163
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:52,660
of all this arrogance because there is a self if we don't have a cell then we will not compare with

164
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:59,460
others it's all because of comparison that we have this kind of thinking this kind of affliction

165
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:07,060
if there's not a me what are we comparing to so we need to replace this arrogance with love

166
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:15,380
unconditional love for all sentient beings we are not better than anyone no one is less than us

167
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:22,420
we are just different conditions what we appear right now is only because of our karma

168
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:30,260
but in this condition everyone is emptiness everyone is a buddha everyone has the buddha

169
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:37,140
nature and we are all one one buddha nature so love all equally

170
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:44,900
do not look down on anyone do not be conceited and disrespect anybody we need to respect

171
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:52,980
everyone equally this is true equality buddha is teaching us the truth we should let go of all our

172
00:11:52,980 --> 00:12:00,100
judgments all our competition do not elevate ourselves to be higher than others because

173
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:06,820
in reality we are really equal so if you can bring yourself to the state of non-violence

174
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:11,700
then you will be able to be free of all the negativeness and all the negativeness and all the

175
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:18,260
negative things and we will be able to have our own true self and our own unconditional love

176
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:26,980
that is when our true nature comes out so look into our arrogance and let it go and let go of the

177
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:32,340
self that's how we experience the state of non-self then that's enlightenment so that's the

178
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,860
class for today thank you for listening
