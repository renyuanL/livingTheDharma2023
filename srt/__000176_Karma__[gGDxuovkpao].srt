00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,600
今天我們要討論的是Karma 什麼是Karma?

2
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:28,600
Karma 意思是你的行動,你的言語和你的想法 實際上創造你的命運

3
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:34,600
所有事情發生在你自己的行動上,我們稱之為Karma

4
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,600
無論你做什麼,都會回到你身上

5
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,600
你的命運創造在你自己的言語,你的想法和你的行動上,我們稱之為Karma

6
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,600
我們有個有名的說法是

7
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:52,600
To know of past life causes, look at the rewards you're reaping today

8
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:58,600
To find out about future lives, you need only notice what you're doing

9
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:06,600
Right now, so you don't need to go to a fortune teller or a psychic to know what you did in your past lifetime

10
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,600
Just look at what you're experiencing today

11
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,600
If you're very wealthy, that means you donated a lot of money, you've been very generous

12
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,600
That's why this lifetime, you're very wealthy

13
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,600
If you're very healthy, that means you were very kind

14
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,600
If you're very attractive, that means you never get mad

15
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,600
So everything has a cause and an effect

16
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,600
And it's all based on your doing

17
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,600
So look at your life right now, then you know what you did before

18
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,600
And to find out about the future, to know about what's going to happen to you later

19
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,600
Look at what you're doing right now

20
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,600
If you always do good deeds, you're always meditating, you're doing great mantras and chanting

21
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,600
You will create a wonderful future for yourself

22
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,600
So notice what you're doing currently

23
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,600
Then you know what your future is going to be

24
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,600
In the Qing Dynasty, there was a student, Mr. Yang

25
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,600
Mr. Yang, he was very rich, grew up in a rich family

26
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,600
And he studies very well

27
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,600
So one time, he went with his friends into the city to take the imperial exam

28
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,600
He was sure that he was going to do well on the exam

29
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,600
Before they went, they went to a fortune teller

30
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,600
The fortune teller looked at him and said, you're very smart

31
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,600
Unfortunately, you're not

32
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,600
You only have three more days to live

33
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,600
You're going to die before the exam

34
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,600
Oh, he was traumatized, he was shot

35
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,600
So at night, he couldn't sleep

36
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,600
He went for a walk

37
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,600
He went for a walk, he saw a lady crying

38
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,600
And he asked, why are you crying?

39
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:45,600
And she said, my husband owes 50 gold pieces to the government

40
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,600
And he's in jail right now

41
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,600
That's why he sold me

42
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,600
Tomorrow, I have to leave my children to be a slave

43
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,600
Mr. Yang said, can I give you the money?

44
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Tomorrow morning, will it still be okay?

45
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,600
And she said, sure

46
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,600
So the next morning, Mr. Yang brought the lady 70 gold pieces

47
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,600
And he said to her, 50 gold pieces for you to return the money to government

48
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,600
And save your husband

49
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,600
And 20 gold pieces for you guys to do some business

50
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,600
So you guys can have a better life

51
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,600
He did that for this lady unconditionally

52
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,600
Just gave her the money

53
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,600
That night, he slept very well

54
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,600
The next day, somebody knocked on his door at the hotel room

55
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,600
When he went to open the door

56
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,600
At the same time, the roof of the hotel room just collapsed

57
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,600
So he went to open the door

58
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,600
He actually saved himself

59
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,600
So why did that happen?

60
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
Because he did a very good deed

61
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,600
The next day, he went to the fortune teller

62
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
The fortune teller looked at him again

63
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,600
He said, oh, congratulations

64
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,600
Your life totally changed

65
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,600
You must have done something really good

66
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,600
You will live to a really old age

67
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,600
And you're gonna be a great government official

68
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,600
Because he did this good deed

69
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,600
To save someone's life unconditionally

70
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,600
Your life is changed by your good deed and bad deed

71
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,600
It's like multiplication

72
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Do good deed, it multiplies

73
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,600
Do bad deed, it's like division

74
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,600
Our life is depending on what we do

75
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,600
We call it the causes

76
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,600
And causes are dependent on three factors

77
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,600
First, your intention

78
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,600
What is your intention

79
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,600
That determines how much the karma weighs

80
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,600
For example, if you drive to work

81
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,600
And the wheel of your car killed a thousand ants

82
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,600
Does that give you negative karma?

83
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
No

84
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,600
Because you didn't do it on purpose

85
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,600
On the other hand, if there's two ants on the table

86
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,600
You purposely killed the ants

87
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
Does that have karma?

88
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Yes

89
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Because why?

90
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,600
It's bad

91
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,600
It's based on intention

92
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,600
When you have the intention of doing something

93
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,600
That makes a big difference

94
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
That's how much the karma weighs

95
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,600
So first, it's depending on your intention

96
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,600
Second, it's dependent on the condition

97
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,600
What do we mean by condition?

98
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,600
Who you do the deed to

99
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,600
For example, if you do a good deed to your parents

100
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,600
To your teacher

101
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,600
Because they are your benefactors

102
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
They do great things for you

103
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
You do good deeds to them

104
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
Then it weighs a lot

105
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
At the same time, if you do bad things

106
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,600
That weighs more than other people

107
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,600
Because they are the most important people to you

108
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,600
So who you do it to really matters too

109
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
No matter to change your karma

110
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
The third is determination

111
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,600
How much you want it

112
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,600
If you go steal someone's money

113
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
But you feel kind of guilty

114
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,600
You don't really want to

115
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,600
But you just really have no money

116
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,600
You feel guilty

117
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,600
If you have no guilt

118
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
You just keep stealing, stealing, stealing

119
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
That will cost a lot

120
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,600
Because you wanted to do it wholeheartedly

121
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
So depending on your motive

122
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,600
And how many times you do the deed

123
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,600
The karma will be different

124
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,600
So the karma is dependent on these three factors

125
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,600
What about the results?

126
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,600
There are actually three kinds of results

127
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,600
First is called ripened results

128
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,600
You do a good deed

129
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,600
The good karma can happen to you

130
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,600
This lifetime

131
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,600
Or next lifetime

132
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,600
Or next year

133
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,600
Or many, many lifetimes later

134
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,600
We don't know

135
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
Because karma is very complex

136
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
It ripens at different times

137
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,600
It can ripen really fast

138
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,600
Or many lifetimes later

139
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,600
So that's called ripened results

140
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,600
The second is called carried over results

141
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,600
You will carry over results

142
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,600
From your prior lifetime

143
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,600
And there are two kinds

144
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,600
One is called carried over behavior

145
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,600
The child whenever he eats

146
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,600
He likes to share

147
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,600
That means what?

148
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
Because prior lifetime

149
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,600
That person loves to share

150
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,600
That's why in this lifetime

151
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,600
Nobody taught him

152
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,600
But he just loves to share

153
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,600
So that is called carried over behavior

154
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,600
From your prior lifetime

155
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,600
And there's also experienced carried over

156
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,600
If you've done a lot of killing

157
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,600
In your prior lifetime

158
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,600
This lifetime

159
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,600
You will experience bad health

160
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,600
And feeling sick all the time

161
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,600
That's called the carried over experience

162
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,600
So we have a lot of carried over karma results

163
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,600
The third is called overall results

164
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,600
That's your environment

165
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,600
If you did a lot of sexual misconduct before

166
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,600
In this lifetime

167
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,600
You will live in a very dirty and messy place

168
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,600
According to the sutra

169
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,600
If you did very well in your prior lifetime

170
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,600
You will live in a beautiful house

171
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,600
In a beautiful country

172
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,600
Beautiful environment

173
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,600
That's all based on what you did before

174
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,600
So what happened to you at your dying day?

175
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,600
At the end

176
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,600
What counts?

177
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,600
What counts and bring you to the next lifetime?

178
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,600
Usually on three things

179
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,600
First is called weighed karma

180
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,600
Weighed karma is kind of like this

181
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,600
If you did something really really significant in this lifetime

182
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,600
You saved someone's life

183
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,600
Or you did something really bad

184
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,600
You actually killed a person

185
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,600
That weighs a lot

186
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,600
A strong negative deed

187
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Or a strong wholesome deed

188
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,600
That will take you to the next round

189
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,600
You can become a heavenly being

190
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
If you did really well

191
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,600
You can go to hell

192
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,600
Animal realm

193
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,600
Or you can be a person again

194
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,600
So it's depending on the weighed karma

195
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
So that's usually the first determinant

196
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,600
The second is called habitual karma

197
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,600
If you didn't do anything very significant this lifetime

198
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,600
You were just ordinary

199
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,600
Not very good

200
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,600
Not very bad

201
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,600
Then it will be dependent on your habit

202
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,600
What do you do all the time in this lifetime?

203
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
Like what's your habit?

204
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,600
If someone is obsessed about drawing horse

205
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,600
Next lifetime

206
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
Next lifetime

207
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,600
They will probably become a horse

208
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,600
Because you're obsessed about drawing the horse

209
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,600
What's your habit this lifetime?

210
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,600
Then you will follow that habit

211
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,600
And have that kind of karma

212
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
If you didn't have much habit

213
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,600
And you don't have much significant deed that you did

214
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,600
It depends on your approximate karma

215
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,600
That means your thoughts at the time you're dying

216
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,600
You think of Amitabha Buddha

217
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,600
At the time when you're dying

218
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,600
He will come and get you

219
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,600
Because you are thinking of him

220
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,600
Whatever you're thinking at the time you're dying

221
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,600
Is very important

222
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
If you are very depressed

223
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,600
Very upset

224
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,600
When you're dying

225
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,600
Then you're likely to go to hell

226
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
So whatever you think about

227
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
At your dying moment

228
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Brings you to the next lifetime

229
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,600
So it's very important to know the cause and the effect

230
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,600
So that's karma for you in a nutshell

231
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,600
So karma is very accurate

232
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
It's never wrong

233
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
Always has its cause and effect

234
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,600
It will never make any mistakes

235
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
So use this lifetime wisely

236
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
To do all that is good

237
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,600
And create a positive and wonderful karma

238
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,600
And destiny for yourself

239
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
So that's it for today

240
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
Thank you for listening

241
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Amitabha
