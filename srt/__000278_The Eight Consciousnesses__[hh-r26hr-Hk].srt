00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,320
Today we are going to talk about the Eight Consciousnesses.

2
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:25,320
In the Consciousness-only school of Buddhism, its main theory is that everything is created

3
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,320
from the Consciousness, hence the word Consciousness-only school.

4
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:38,280
This means everything is based upon the coming into being and the ceasing to be of the Consciousness,

5
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,720
therefore it's impermanent, it's conditioned, and unreal.

6
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:49,760
By knowing what is unreal, then we can discover what is real, which is our originally pure,

7
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,700
bright, enlightened mind.

8
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,080
Today we will use verses from the Verses Deliverer.

9
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:01,840
First, let's have an overview of the Eight Consciousnesses.

10
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,760
The first five consciousnesses are eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and body.

11
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,760
These five are in direct contact with the external world.

12
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,920
Then we have the sixth consciousness that is our thinking mind that conceptualizes everything.

13
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,080
We also have the seventh consciousness, the ego consciousness that only thinks about the

14
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,080
self.

15
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,380
Then we come to the eighth consciousness, the storehouse of the self.

16
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,960
So that's how our Eight Consciousnesses work together.

17
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,580
Now let's look at them in detail.

18
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,620
It's divided up into four sections.

19
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:44,360
The first five consciousnesses are together, then the sixth consciousness, the seventh

20
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,560
consciousness, and the eighth consciousness are divided up separately.

21
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,840
Now let's first talk about the first five consciousnesses.

22
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,840
All five consciousnesses rely on the Eight Consciousnesses.

23
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,760
They rely on their own pure form organs.

24
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,560
Because they are in contact with the external world, they must have organs.

25
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,960
There are two kinds of sensory organs.

26
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,040
One is the visible physical organs.

27
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,400
The second type is the pure form organs.

28
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,700
That's our neural pathways or something that is not visible.

29
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,220
We usually use the example of the flower pot.

30
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,720
The pot outside is the visible physical organ.

31
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,200
The soil inside is the pure form organ.

32
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,980
And the flower growing out of it, that's our consciousness.

33
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,800
So without the soil, there won't be any flowers.

34
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,340
There won't be any consciousness working.

35
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,940
So that's why we have to have the pure form organs.

36
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:50,840
Furthermore, they require nine, eight, or seven conditions working together as neighbors.

37
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,760
In order for us to see the world, we actually need nine.

38
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,120
Nine preconditions.

39
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,920
The first one is we need to have distance.

40
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,640
If you look at something this close, you won't be able to see anything.

41
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,720
Two, we need light.

42
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,640
Without light, we cannot see.

43
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,360
Three, we need the organs like we said above.

44
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,080
Number four, we need to have an object, the thing that we want to look at.

45
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,500
Then we also need attention to focus our consciousness on the object.

46
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,840
Then we have the sixth consciousness.

47
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,720
The basis of the consciousness.

48
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,720
The basis of discrimination.

49
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:31,620
The seventh consciousness, the basis of defilement and purity.

50
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,420
And the eighth consciousness, the fundamental basis.

51
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:41,500
And number nine, we need the seed, the karmic seed of the consciousness in order for the

52
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,080
consciousness to arrive.

53
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:49,060
So we need all nine conditions in order for us to see one object.

54
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:53,080
It actually requires a lot for us to be able to see.

55
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:58,080
And in order for us to hear, we need eight conditions.

56
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,000
We subtract the lights because we don't need lights to hear.

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,960
And for our nose, tongue, and body, we subtract light and distance because they are in direct

58
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:14,540
contact with the object of our smell, taste, and touch.

59
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:21,320
So as you can see, we need a lot of conditions working together like neighbors in order for

60
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,080
us to be in contact with the object.

61
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,080
So we need a lot of conditions working together like neighbors in order for us to be in contact

62
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:23,540
with the object of our smell, taste, and touch.

63
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,040
So we need a lot of conditions working together like neighbors in order for us to be in contact

64
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,540
with the object of our smell, taste, and touch.

65
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,040
So we need a lot of conditions working together like neighbors in order for us to be in contact

66
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,540
with the object of our smell, taste, and touch.

67
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,180
So, why do we need to know this?

68
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:26,680
So little cognitive testing experiences can help us learn more about the external world.

69
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,120
Why do we need to know this?

70
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,960
But this is from far away.

71
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,540
Is that my perspective.

72
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:36,560
Dr.

73
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,000
Shifu Jiening.

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,600
It was common knowledge.

75
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,080
Dr.

76
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,500
Shifu Jiening.

77
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,860
Here, what we are observing as we look at the

78
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,060
external world focused on these five things the economic , political, social, and

79
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,140
environmental health impact.

80
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,720
Why do we need to know this?

81
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:56,280
is tricking you. By understanding how our consciousness works, then we won't be afraid

82
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:03,460
of height anymore. So this conscious only school of Buddhism is actually the psychology

83
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:08,520
of Buddhism that will help us overcome a lot of our emotions.

84
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:14,960
Now let's look at our sixth consciousness. In physical action and in speech, it is the

85
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:22,220
most important. Our sixth consciousness, that's how we create karma. It has a lot of karma

86
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:29,880
generating power because it directs our body to take action and our mouth to make speech.

87
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:36,500
So that's how we make our wholesome and unwholesome deeds. That's why it has the ability to

88
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:44,020
summon forth the power of karma that leads to rebirth and retribution. There are two

89
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:44,940
kinds of karma.

90
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:52,000
The first is summoning karma. It brings us to the realm of rebirth. For example, the

91
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,060
heavenly realm or the human realm or the hungry ghost realm. So that's the major karma.

92
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:04,000
Number two, we have the retribution karma, which is the lesser degree. Once you're

93
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
reborn in that realm, the retribution can be very different. For example, in the animal

94
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,920
realm. If you're a stray dog, you might have a very difficult life. But if you're

95
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:20,900
in the million dollar home, you might have a lot of servants taking care of you. So your

96
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:27,160
retribution might be very different, even you're both in the animal realm. So use our

97
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:34,620
sixth consciousness wisely to cultivate all the goodness and eradicate all our bad deeds.

98
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:40,060
When Buddha was around, one day there was a young girl sweeping the front courtyard

99
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,420
of her house. Buddha passed by with the Sangha.

100
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,920
This girl saw Buddha. She said,

101
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:51,800
She felt a great sense of joy and elation, and she was gazing upon Buddha in awe and

102
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:58,240
admiration. Because of this good deed, after she passed away, she was reborn in the heavenly

103
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,720
realm. She knew that it was because of this one good deed, she was reborn there. So she

104
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:10,300
came back to thank Buddha. Buddha expounded Dharma to her, and she actually became enlightened

105
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,900
and obtained Arhatshet. So from this one good thought of being joyfully

106
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:21,360
beautiful, seeing Buddha, that created a lot of great positive karma for her. So use our

107
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,360
sixth consciousness wisely.

108
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:30,220
Now let's look at the seventh consciousness. It continuously follows and grasps the object

109
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:35,660
of the self. The seventh consciousness, it doesn't come in contact with the external

110
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:41,880
world. It only tells the sixth consciousness what to think based on the self, and it just

111
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,780
attaches to the eighth consciousness as the self.

112
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:53,940
So, it has 4 strong innate afflictions. Number one, it has the self delusion. It doesn't understand

113
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:59,900
that we are the pure enlightened mind. So it keeps attaching to the self as the real

114
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:05,900
personhood. That's why it's an ignorant and delusion. Number two, we have view of the

115
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:13,020
self. Our view of the self becomes very stubborn and very strong, and we are full of this ego.

116
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,460
Then we have number three.

117
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:22,480
our self-conceit. We become very arrogant. We compete, compare, and be jealous of others.

118
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:29,500
Number four, we have self-love. We love the self and we do everything to benefit the self.

119
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:36,380
Even if you're born as a fish in a tank, the fishes will fight over territories. The same

120
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:42,860
kind of fish will get together and fight against the other group. So everyone is attached to the

121
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:50,440
sense of the self. That's why we keep reincarnating. So day and night, it induces the state of dreaming

122
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:58,000
and confusion in living beings. Because of this consciousness, day and night, we are reduced to

123
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:05,220
the state of dreaming and confusion. If you ever notice, in your dream, you're always the main

124
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:11,440
character because we're so full of the self. That's due to our seventh consciousness. The

125
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,360
eighth consciousness.

126
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:20,720
It undergoes perfuming and contains the seeds of organs, body, and the environment. The eighth

127
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:27,980
consciousness has two major jobs. The first, it undergoes perfuming. Whatever the first seven

128
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:33,840
consciousness does, it perfumes and permeates the eighth consciousness. The eighth consciousness

129
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:40,160
doesn't produce any karma. It's all produced by the first seven consciousnesses and stores them.

130
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,740
So the eighth consciousness is constantly,

131
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:48,920
being permeated and influenced by the first seven consciousnesses.

132
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:56,300
Number two, it contains the karmic seeds of everything, so everything we've ever done

133
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:03,840
are seen is all cumulated as karmic seeds in the storehouse. So it's a big warehouse

134
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:12,040
that stores all our karma. When the conditions are right, the seeds ripen into results. The

135
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:20,460
result is our organs, our body, and the environment, basically the entire material world. So the

136
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:30,540
entire world is created by our own alaya consciousness. That's the truth, the reality of the universe.

137
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:38,560
Furthermore, it is the one who comes first and leaves last being truly a master of the

138
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:46,160
house. When we pass away it is the last one to leave this body. Even though we are medically

139
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:52,720
pronounced dead, the eighth consciousness still lingers on for 8 hours or even up to

140
00:10:52,720 --> 00:11:00,360
36 hours. That's why we have to have people that help you chen omitofo even after your

141
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:06,580
last breath. Because the eighth consciousness is still there. When we take rebirth it is

142
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,540
the first one to get into the house.

143
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:14,960
the mother's womb because it's the first one to come in so this eighth consciousness is what

144
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:24,000
carries us throughout our reincarnation and through samsara so this is our life by understanding this

145
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:32,500
we actually can learn a lot first we need to know that karma and reincarnation is real we have to

146
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:41,140
use our consciousness to cultivate goodness and eradicate our bad deeds number two we need to know

147
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:50,140
this eighth consciousness is all conditioned none of it is me as we perceive this is not the real me

148
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:58,960
the thinking mind everything is not the real me the real me is actually the originally pure bright

149
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,120
enlightened mind that's who we really are

150
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:10,420
so by understanding what is unreal we can go back to what is real we want to be apart from the

151
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:17,840
heart the mind and the consciousness we usually call the eight consciousness the heart the seven

152
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:25,180
consciousness the mind and the sixth consciousness the consciousness so we actually want to be apart

153
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:31,580
from the heart the mind and the consciousness that's how we're supposed to be

154
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:31,980
we're supposed to be apart

155
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:39,460
living in our originally pure, bright, enlightened mind. So that's the class for

156
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:43,560
today. Thank you for listening. Amitabha.
