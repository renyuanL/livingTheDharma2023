1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,900
Today's topic is on emptiness.

2
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:23,920
Emptiness means all things have no independent existence of its own apart from reliance on

3
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,920
other conditions.

4
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:32,260
We will use Bodhisattva Nagarjuna's The Treaty of Great Wisdom to understand emptiness.

5
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:35,160
It talks about 18 types of emptiness.

6
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,040
Number one, the emptiness of the internal.

7
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,800
That's the sixth sense organs of the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body and mind.

8
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,100
Number two is the emptiness of the external.

9
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,900
That's the sixth sense objects of the sight, sound, smell, taste, touch and dharma.

10
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,900
Number three is the emptiness of the internal.

11
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,980
That's the sixth sense objects of the internal and the external.

12
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:02,660
So in the internal organs and the external objects, there is not a sense of eye.

13
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,200
So this is talking about non-self.

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:11,780
In our daily lives, we have to learn to have emptying experience, which means to remove

15
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,000
the eye and the mind from our thoughts.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,240
Emptiness is a great tool to extricate us of ego-centered experience and to liberate

17
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,240
us from the presence of selfishness.

18
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,500
Number four, emptiness of emptiness.

19
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,680
It's the emptying of the first three.

20
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,260
Emptiness is a tool.

21
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:39,280
Once we demolish afflictions of the self, we need to let go of the dharma as well.

22
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,760
So emptying of the self and emptying of the dharma.

23
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:48,660
Let go of our attachment to the self and let go of our attachment to the dharma.

24
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:54,000
Just like if we go upstairs, then we don't need to carry the stair with us once we get

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,920
up there. Just like we are sick, we eat medicine. After we are cured, we don't need to have

26
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,780
the medicine anymore. Just like if a strong man fought off the thieves in our house, once

27
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:11,740
the thieves are gone, we don't need the strong man in the house anymore. So that's the emptiness

28
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:18,740
of emptiness. So we need to get rid of the tool as well. Number five, emptiness of the

29
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:23,720
great. It's talking about the emptiness of space. We are all attached to the concept

30
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:29,680
of space. This is a big house or big land. If we let go of our attachment to space, we

31
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,920
actually can experience something that's limitless. In the Practice and Vow of Universal Vorti

32
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:43,460
Bodhisattva, it says, in one mold of dust are lands as numerous as molds of dust. In

33
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:48,720
each land are an incalculable number of Buddhas. Small as a dust, small as a mold of dust,

34
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,320
there are numerous Buddha lands. And in each Buddha land, there's numerous Buddhas. That's

35
00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:01,680
the world of bodhisattvas experience. If we just open up our heart to prajna and to emptiness,

36
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,820
we can experience much more when we let go of our attachment to space. Number six is

37
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:16,020
emptiness of the ultimate. Ultimate means nirvana. Sometimes we become attached to nirvana,

38
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,720
to what's the ultimate.

39
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,700
But when you're

40
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:24,600
attached to the ultimate, it's no longer the ultimate. In the Diamond Sutra, Shakyamuni

41
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:32,260
Buddha said to Shri Puti, in the neutral sammyaksambodhi that I have fulfilled, there's not even a

42
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:41,180
modicum of Dharma to be obtainable. Such state is denominated as a neutral sammyaksambodhi.

43
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:47,660
So there is not obtaining of enlightenment. Because once you have attachment to it, it's

44
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,660
no longer enlightenment.

45
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:57,200
So prajna or emptiness does not allow you to build any credential or build any self-identity

46
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,960
to be someone special. We need to let go of all attachment in order to be awakened.

47
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:11,780
Number seven is to emptiness of the compounded phenomena. Compounded phenomena means all

48
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:18,460
conditioned phenomena. Everything is conditioned existence that we are experiencing right now.

49
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:25,460
We need to understand they are only conditioned arising based on causation. For example, the

50
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:32,240
father is a father because he has a son. The son only exists because there's a father.

51
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,920
And the father is also a son to the grandfather. This is all conditioned arising. If we just

52
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:44,800
respect all conditioned and play our part in our lives, then we be the best that we

53
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,820
can be. Be a good son, be a good father.

54
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,440
Subtitles by the Amara.org community

55
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:55,220
In all situations, we go with the flow, be flexible, and do the best that we can. That's

56
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:00,320
someone who really have the view of prajna and emptiness.

57
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:07,020
Number eight is the emptiness of uncompounded phenomena. Uncompounded phenomena means the

58
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:13,180
same as the ultimate, something that's not conditioned because it is the ultimate. But

59
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,820
we should know we cannot be attached to the uncompounded phenomena easily.

60
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:25,600
Because uncompounded phenomena only exist because there's such thing as compounded

61
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:32,440
phenomena. If we are attached to the uncompounded phenomena, it's no longer the uncompounded

62
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:39,860
phenomena. So we need to really understand the wisdom in this conditioned arising. So

63
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:46,480
do not be attached to what's the ultimate, what's uncompounded either. Number nine, the

64
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,520
emptiness of what has been. We need to be aware of the emptiness of what has been. Remember,

65
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:47,700
also because the emptiness of what has been is zero. You should not be attached to your

66
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:55,680
past beyond the extremes. It's the emptiness of the first eight. They all need to be empty.

67
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:02,360
So you want to demolish all your attachments until there's nothing left to demolish. That's

68
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:09,700
the Garjuna's specialty. It's a great refutation of everything. So let go, know everything,

69
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:16,300
its condition arising, and it has no intrinsic nature of its own, then we can see beyond

70
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:22,400
everything. But some people say, if I empty everything, let go everything, then I have

71
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:28,400
nothing. Isn't that scary? Actually, if you think about it, you have never really lost

72
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:34,340
anything because you never possessed anything in the first place. Emptiness, it's like a

73
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:40,780
double-edged sword. It cuts through our afflictions. It also cuts the person who is holding the

74
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:46,280
sword. So we need to use the sword, but let go of the sword at the end.

75
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:46,300
So we need to use the sword, but let go of the sword at the end. So we need to use the

76
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:51,320
sword, but let go of the sword at the end. Number 10 is the emptiness of what is beginningless

77
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:59,740
and endless. So number 5 is the emptying of space. Number 10 is the emptiness of time.

78
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:05,440
Because we're attached to time, Buddha tells us about beginningless and endless. A lot

79
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:12,460
of people ask, when did reincarnation start? Did we have death first or rebirth first?

80
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:16,280
All these questions have no definite answer.

81
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:22,800
Buddha just used beginningless and endless to demolish your attachment to the concept

82
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,820
of time. Once you demolish your attachment to time, then we do not want to attach to

83
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:36,720
beginningless or endless either. Number 11 is the emptiness of the indestructible. It's

84
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:44,340
talking about the emptiness of things in their part and as a whole. For example, a car is

85
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,260
made out of car parts. It can be a car, it can be a car, it can be a car, it can be a

86
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,260
car, it can be a car, it can be a car, it can be a car, it can be a car, it can be a car,

87
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,100
it can be a car, it can be a car, it can be a car, it can be a car, it can be a car, it

88
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,100
can be a car, it can be a car, it can be a car, it can be a car, it can be a car. It

89
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:54,720
cannot be a car without its parts but the parts do not equal the car. So both the car

90
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:02,140
and the parts, they have no real existence of their own. They are just conditioned existences.

91
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:08,520
Once you really understand this, you will not be sad or upset when it breaks or things

92
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:14,740
change, because you already saw that it's a conditioned existence and it's not going

93
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,040
to last forever.

94
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,280
So once we have this prajna of emptiness,

95
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,100
when things change, we will be able to accept

96
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,140
and be the best that we can

97
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,800
and not be caught up in the situation.

98
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,140
Number 12 is the emptiness of nature.

99
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:33,900
Number 13 is the emptiness of all phenomena.

100
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,900
Nature means the inner essence.

101
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,540
All phenomena means its appearance.

102
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:42,420
Are we the same inside and outside?

103
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,780
Sometimes when we do good deeds,

104
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,800
when other people are watching,

105
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,240
but actually in the prajna,

106
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,360
it's like the sun that's illuminating everywhere.

107
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,320
We are under the spotlight all the time

108
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,620
and we are fully exposed.

109
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,300
So there's nowhere to hide under prajna.

110
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,980
Know that when you're really cultivating,

111
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,180
do not fool yourself that you're practicing.

112
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,480
Be the same inside and outside.

113
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,460
14, emptiness of definitions.

114
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,460
All definitions.

115
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:18,080
And all names are just a name.

116
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,980
For example, the six sense organs,

117
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:24,940
the six sense objects, the 18 rounds,

118
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,840
everything is just a name.

119
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,480
It's only forced to demolish our attachment to the self,

120
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,100
but do not be attached to the concept either.

121
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,280
A lot of people are attached to name brand things

122
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,020
or your title or your credential,

123
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,080
but all of these are just human made concept.

124
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,720
They have no real essence

125
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,160
or real value.

126
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,160
So see through all the definitions.

127
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:53,300
15 is the emptiness of the unapprehensible.

128
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,040
This is the opposite of the definition.

129
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,540
What's definable and what's undefinable.

130
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:04,040
This unapprehensible means the unattainable

131
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,260
or what we say the ultimate,

132
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,780
something that is hard to see or hard to describe.

133
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:13,660
But if you're attached to something that is unattainable,

134
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,600
then it loses meaning.

135
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:14,620
So if you're attached to something that is unattainable, then it loses meaning.

136
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:17,440
It's no longer the ultimate.

137
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,740
Just like if you see a hand.

138
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,000
In the five fingers, you do not see a fist.

139
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,060
So in all the phenomenons,

140
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:29,320
you do not see anything that's attainable or unattainable.

141
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,040
Number 16 is the emptiness of non-things.

142
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,240
When things cease to be, we do not lose anything.

143
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,720
Number 17, emptiness of its own emptiness.

144
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,500
When things arise, we do not get them.

145
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,800
We do not gain anything.

146
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,700
Number 18, emptiness of the inherent existence of non-things.

147
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,020
When things exist, we are not happy.

148
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:59,860
When things cease to be, we are not sad.

149
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:04,980
When you have this wisdom, you have real peace in your mind.

150
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,440
That's the prajna of emptiness.

151
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:14,380
The 18, emptiness is truly empty and truly non-empty.

152
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:20,140
When you realize emptiness, you can eradicate all your afflictions and all your attachments

153
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:23,360
and all your problems, and you will be at peace.

154
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,380
So this is only a glimpse of emptiness.

155
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:33,660
It's for you to come up with your own questions and have creative doubts about emptiness.

156
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:40,700
So you can use and see emptiness in your daily life and see the truth more clearly.

157
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,260
When we really understand emptiness, we'll be soaring.

158
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:47,020
Like an eagle who sees from above.

159
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,760
That's the class for today.

160
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,760
Thank you for listening.

161
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,760
Amitabha.
