00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Today we are going to talk about the Sutra of Complete Enlightenment.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This Sutra consists of 12 Bodhisattvas asking Shakyamuni Buddha how to practice and reach

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
perfect enlightenment. I summarize the points of the 12 chapters on this board.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
1. Bodhisattva Manjushri asked Shakyamuni Buddha,

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
What is the causal ground of all Buddhas? Shakyamuni Buddha answered,

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It is the complete illumination of intrinsic enlightenment.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's like we have the perfect mirror that reflects everything clearly without being attached

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
to anything that's happening in the mirror.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This is our pure mind. This mind is the intrinsic enlightenment.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
That means we're originally enlightened. We have to start our practice from this causal ground,

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
which means start from your true suchness, your perfect complete enlightenment.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Just like if we're trying to cook rice, we have to put rice into the rice cooker.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
If we put sand into the rice cooker, you will only get hot air.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So if we do not start with the right causal ground, we will not reach enlightenment.

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
No matter how much Buddha you chant, how much offering you give, how much precepts you observe,

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
that is not going to work.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
2. Bodhisattva Samantabhadra asked Shakyamuni Buddha,

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
How to reach the Sun Enlightenment? Shakyamuni Buddha answered,

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
To know illusion is to depart from it. To depart from it is to be enlightened.

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The secret is in this verse. All we have to do is to know illusion.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Everything that's going on right now, we are attached to it.

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We do not understand its illusion.

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Now what you have to do is to have a clear understanding.

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
See through the reality you're experiencing right now.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
All the people in your life, your family, your work, all your possessions,

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
it doesn't belong to you.

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's like the things that's happening in your dream.

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
If you can see this clearly in this present life right now, you will be enlightened.

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So all you have to do is to know what is illusion,

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
which is basically everything that's happening right now.

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You see it with the clear eyes.

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Then you will depart from it, which means you will be detached.

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You will no longer let these things drive you.

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
They drive your happiness and sadness.

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We have the perfect enlightened mind, but we're giving our power away

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
when we're dwelling in what is going on right now.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So to depart from it, it is to be enlightened.

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Enlightenment is departing from illusion.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Separate from what's going on.

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
This person yelling at you is not happening right now.

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It is a condition arising.

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It will go away the next minute.

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Nothing is permanent.

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Nothing is real.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's all illusion.

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You just have to see, then you will reach this complete enlightenment.

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
This is called the sudden enlightenment method.

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The third, bodhisattva universal vision.

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Basically, it's Guanyin Bodhisattva.

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
She wants to know if we cannot do the sudden enlightenment,

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
is there a gradual practice we can do?

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Shakyamuni Buddha's answer is to know our body and mind are illusory flowers.

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
This gradual step is not different from the sudden enlightenment method.

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's basically the same, but in more detail.

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You have to see the illusory nature of your body and mind.

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
In this sutra, it uses the main example of the illusory flowers.

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
We have sickness in our eyes.

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So we see there's lots of flowers in the sky.

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But in reality, the sky has no flowers.

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The sky symbolizes our intrinsic enlightenment, the true mind.

61
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
We have optical obstructions that prevent us from seeing the truth.

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
All our body and mind is just illusory flowers.

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You think your body is the real me.

64
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You think your thoughts,

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
your concept is the real me.

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But that is all ignorance.

67
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Our true nature is non-self.

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's emptiness.

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The sky is originally empty,

70
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
but you see all these flowers.

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That's why we're deluded and confused.

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
There is no flower in the sky.

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The sky is perfectly clear,

74
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
just like our intrinsic enlightenment.

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Number four is Bodhisattva Vajragarbha.

76
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Now it's talking about self-enlightenment.

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
How do we become self-enlightened?

78
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Again, Shakyamuni Buddha answered,

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
the sky originally has no flowers.

80
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The flower is not caused by the sky.

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The sky is originally empty,

82
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
and there's no flower to start with.

83
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You cannot say,

84
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
how did the flowers extinguish?

85
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Because there's no place it came from,

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and there's no place

87
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
it extinguished.

88
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The flower itself never existed in the sky.

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
That is how we attain self-enlightenment.

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
This chapter also gives another example,

91
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
smelting gold out of the ore.

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Our Buddha nature is the perfect gold.

93
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The gold does not come from the process of smelting.

94
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It is originally 24 karat gold.

95
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Once you go through this process,

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
you will not go back to the ore again.

97
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Just like if we reach Buddhahood,

98
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
are we going to get back to this ordinary being

99
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
full of greed, anger and ignorance?

100
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
No, we will never go back

101
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
because we are originally the perfect pure gold.

102
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
The fifth chapter is the enlightenment of others.

103
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
This is Bodhisattva Maitreya.

104
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Bodhisattva Maitreya asked Shakyamuni Buddha,

105
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
what is the cause of samsara?

106
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Shakyamuni Buddha's answer,

107
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
cyclic existence is due to all kinds of affection,

108
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
love, craving and desire.

109
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Basically all are clinging,

110
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
love, desire and lust.

111
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
This is how we have reincarnation,

112
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
the continuation of life and birth.

113
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
If we do not have love and affection,

114
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
that is tainted,

115
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
we will not have reincarnation.

116
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
This chapter talks about

117
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
because of this,

118
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
we have two kinds of obstructions.

119
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
One is the obstruction of principle.

120
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Two is the obstruction of phenomenon.

121
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Principle is basically

122
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
we think everything outside of us is real.

123
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Obstruction of phenomenon is

124
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
we think there is a real me.

125
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So these two kinds of obstructions

126
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
hinder us from reaching enlightenment

127
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
and continue to be in this cyclic existence.

128
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So out of these two kinds of obstructions,

129
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
we have five nature of people.

130
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
One is ordinary beings.

131
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
They have not eradicated

132
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
any of the two kinds of obstructions.

133
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
That's why they are ordinary mundane people.

134
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Number two is the shravaka

135
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
and pratyekabuddha nature.

136
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
People who already eradicated

137
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
their obstruction of phenomenon,

138
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
but not yet eradicated

139
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
their obstruction of the principle.

140
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
They got rid of the self,

141
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
but they still don't see the reality of the world.

142
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The third nature is bodhisattvas.

143
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
They do get rid of both kinds of obstructions.

144
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So they will eventually reach

145
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Buddhahood.

146
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The fourth nature is people who are unstable.

147
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
If they meet good teachers,

148
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
they will reach enlightenment.

149
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But if they meet people that are bad influences,

150
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
they will go down the wrong path

151
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
because of the wrong views.

152
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Number five is people with the outer path nature,

153
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
which means they like other religions and practices.

154
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Or you can say they are people who think

155
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
there is a truth outside of their own mind.

156
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Number six is bodhisattva pure wisdom.

157
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
This bodhisattva wants to know

158
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
how do we accord with this intrinsic enlightenment?

159
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Shakyamuni Buddha answered,

160
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
we have four kinds of accordance

161
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
with the nature of enlightenment.

162
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's kind of like the five nature of people.

163
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Now it's four levels of attainment.

164
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The first one is the ordinary people's

165
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
accordance with the nature of enlightenment.

166
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Even though they get rid of their toil and anxiety,

167
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
but they are still caught up

168
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
in their knowledge of this purity.

169
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
They don't have the freedom and ease

170
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
with their true nature.

171
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
The second accordance is the lower level bodhisattvas.

172
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The third is the higher level bodhisattvas.

173
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
The fourth is the Tathagata, the Buddha.

174
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
The second accordance is the lower level bodhisattvas.

175
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
They understand and they get rid of the hindrance,

176
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
but their knowledge of the obstructions

177
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
becomes a hindrance in itself.

178
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
The third is the higher level bodhisattvas.

179
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
They know eradicating hindrance itself

180
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
is only a dharma tool.

181
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
They are not caught up with this cultivation

182
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
so they are more at ease with their practice.

183
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Lastly, it's the Tathagata's

184
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
accordance with the nature of enlightenment.

185
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
At this stage, samsara is nirvana.

186
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Affliction is bodhi.

187
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Everything is one.

188
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
There's no more duality.

189
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
All the problems, all the hell and heaven,

190
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
they are all pure land.

191
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
That's the last level of

192
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
accordance with the nature of enlightenment.

193
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Chapter seven is bodhisattva at ease in majestic virtue.

194
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
This bodhisattva wants to know about

195
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
how do we actually practice meditation.

196
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
If we cannot have certain enlightenment,

197
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
do we have ways of meditation?

198
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Now Shakyamuni Buddha teaches three singular meditations.

199
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Samatha, Samapati, Dhyana.

200
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
These are three names of meditation.

201
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Basically, Samatha is void meditation.

202
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Understanding the emptiness of all things

203
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
and you stay in the stillness.

204
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Number two, Samapati is to contemplate

205
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
that everything is illusory.

206
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
So the key word here is illusion.

207
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You have to see everything as existing,

208
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
as illusion.

209
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Then you have great compassion

210
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
for all sentient beings

211
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
because you have no more self.

212
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Lastly is Dhyana.

213
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Dhyana is a combination of the two.

214
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
This is the mean meditation.

215
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
When you combine emptiness

216
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
and illusory existence,

217
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
that is the middle way.

218
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
We call it the mean.

219
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
So that's the seventh chapter

220
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
teaching us how to actually practice meditation.

221
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Eighth chapter is Bodhisattva sound discernment.

222
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Now the three singular meditations

223
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
have different combinations

224
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
for a total of 25 kinds of samadhis.

225
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
So out of the three,

226
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
now it's 25.

227
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Seven start with Samatha,

228
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
seven that starts with Samapati,

229
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
and seven that starts with Dhyana.

230
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
For a total of 21,

231
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
plus the first three originally,

232
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
the 25th is basically the combination

233
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
of all of them.

234
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
If you want to practice meditation,

235
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
you can use any one of the 25 kinds of samadhi.

236
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You will reach this level of enlightenment.

237
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Number nine is Bodhisattva

238
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
cleanse of all karmic obstructions.

239
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
We often have problems in our meditation

240
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
because of our faults.

241
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
So number nine is our self-inflicted faults

242
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
in our meditation.

243
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Number 10 is other inflicted faults

244
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
in our meditation.

245
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
How come we cannot succeed

246
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
in our meditation practice?

247
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Because we have these sicknesses.

248
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Self-inflicted sickness is because

249
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
we are caught up with four forms.

250
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
This is discussed in the Diamond Sutra as well.

251
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
We are caught up in the sign of self,

252
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
the sign of others,

253
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
the sign of sentient beings,

254
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
and lifespan.

255
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
This is why we cannot succeed

256
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
in our meditation.

257
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Because we have an ego,

258
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
we are in opposition with all other person.

259
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Everybody else is outside of us.

260
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
So we have competition.

261
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
We have jealousy.

262
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
We have problems.

263
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Because we have these views,

264
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
we cannot reach enlightenment.

265
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
All sentient beings in this space and time,

266
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
they are in opposition with the self.

267
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And in this lifespan,

268
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
in terms of time and space,

269
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
we all have strong thinking of dualism.

270
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Because of these false views,

271
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
we cannot be a Bodhisattva.

272
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
So if you practice meditation,

273
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
but you still have strong sense of these four forms,

274
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
you cannot become enlightened.

275
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Number 10 now is talking about

276
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
other inflicted faults.

277
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Bodhisattva Universal Enlightenment

278
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
asked about what other faults do we have

279
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
in our meditation.

280
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
How come we cannot succeed in our meditation?

281
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Shakyamuni Buddha says

282
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
we have four kinds of faults

283
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
that are learned from the wrong teacher.

284
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Or other people give you false

285
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
ideas.

286
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
The first one is contrivance.

287
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
When you think you have to do certain practice,

288
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
exert yourself with a lot of energy

289
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
in order to become enlightened.

290
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
This is a false view.

291
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Enlightenment is originally with thinness.

292
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
It's not from exerting yourself really hard.

293
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Second one is naturalism.

294
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
The opposite.

295
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Some people are very lazy.

296
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
They think I don't have to practice

297
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
because samsara is nirvana.

298
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Nirvana and affliction is bodhi.

299
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
So I just let everything be as it is.

300
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You have this kind of view,

301
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
you cannot succeed in your meditation either.

302
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
The third one is stopping.

303
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Some people think I just stop all thoughts.

304
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Then that's enlightenment.

305
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Stopping all thoughts is not in accordance

306
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
with your intrinsic enlightenment.

307
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
That's not the way either.

308
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Number four is annihilation.

309
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Some people think I just get rid of all my afflictions.

310
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
That's it.

311
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Emptiness.

312
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Nothingness.

313
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
That is enlightenment.

314
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
That is also a false view.

315
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
If you have any kinds of these wrong views,

316
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
you cannot succeed in your meditation.

317
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Chapter 11 is Bodhisattva of Complete Enlightenment.

318
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
He asked if we cannot do any of these,

319
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
what do we do?

320
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
So Buddha tells us expedient path.

321
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Basically,

322
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
you have to have utmost sincere repentance.

323
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You have to do 21 days of concentrated confession.

324
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
If you can confess single-mindedly,

325
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
you can get rid of problems in your meditation.

326
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
If you don't confess,

327
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
you cannot get rid of your common obstacles.

328
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You cannot really sit there and meditate.

329
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You cannot even bring yourself to sit there for a long time.

330
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Lastly is the 12th chapter,

331
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
this is the Bodhisattva foremost in virtue and goodness.

332
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
This is the dissemination chapter of the Sutra.

333
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,000
The Sutra is the pure eye of the 12 divisions of Buddhist scriptures.

334
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
There are 12 canons of Buddhist scriptures.

335
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Some are long discourses.

336
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Some are gathas and verses.

337
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Some are Shakyamuni Buddha stories.

338
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Some are metaphors and parables.

339
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
There are 12 canons.

340
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
But this Sutra is the pure eye.

341
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
That means you understand all kinds of Sutras.

342
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
If you understand this Sutra,

343
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
then you understand all Dharma.

344
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You understand how to be enlightened.

345
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
You understand the truth about all Buddhist scriptures.

346
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:24,000
So this is the synopsis of the Sutra of Complete Enlightenment.

347
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
All 12 Bodhisattvas,

348
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
they are not people.

349
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
They are not people outside of us.

350
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
These 12 Bodhisattvas are you.

351
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
You are the Buddha.

352
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You are the Bodhisattva.

353
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You are Manjushri.

354
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
You are Samantabhadra.

355
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
These are not talking about other people.

356
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
They are you.

357
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Because you originally have this perfect enlightenment within your mind.

358
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
The mind is the Buddha.

359
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Buddha is the mind.

360
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
That's the class for today.

361
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Thank you for listening.

362
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Amitabha.
