00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:36,560
entire company. It actually created everything. You can call it my soul. This

17
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,880
will die with your body dying but this will not die. It goes on with every

18
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:49,680
lifetime carries with you. The Alaya means the storehouse. It stores

19
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,920
everything that you ever done in your every lifetime. It's like a super

20
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,900
computer. It remembers everything. When the right causes and the

21
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:07,380
condition hits, it creates reality. So everything that you're experiencing

22
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:18,000
today is based on your Alaya. For example, we see the Azusa mountain here. Is it

23
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,400
real? It's not real. It's all of us here

24
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:25,900
are

25
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:32,980
Alaya. We have the same kind of causes, same kind of karma from prior

26
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:38,720
experiences create the mountain that we're seeing today. So everything is

27
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,680
created by the Alaya. That's why we say your mind creates the universe. We're not

28
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,940
kidding. It's true. Your mind creates everything that you experience. You just

29
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:55,380
don't know. Your Alaya stores everything you ever did at the right time. It will

30
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:01,040
bring out the effect of whatever you did before. Your wholesome and unwholesome

31
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,760
deed at the right time. It happens you know whoever you're married to today

32
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:12,820
whoever it's your mom who is your dad is all based on what you store here. So it's

33
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:18,360
amazing that after you understand this eight conscious what do you do. So there's

34
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,820
actually two things to change your life. First is you want to change where? When.

35
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:32,100
here because you cannot change it it's very stubborn it doesn't change it just

36
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:37,280
hold on to the idea of me okay so all you have to do is change here change what you

37
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,720
think how you think you gotta be positive and wholesome and get rid of all

38
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:49,880
the unwholesome negative thoughts okay because it creates reality it goes up

39
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:54,400
here everything that you're thinking every day it comes up here and it gets

40
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,080
stored and it becomes your future nobody creates your future your own mind

41
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,160
creates the future so change your thought you change your world there's a

42
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,500
mom she has two daughters the older daughter marries someone that sells

43
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,360
umbrella the younger daughter marries someone that sells ice cream so when it's

44
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:22,360
raining she starts crying because like oh the younger daughter's ice cream will

45
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,960
not sell so she starts crying

46
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,000
it's sunny she started crying again because the older daughter's umbrella

47
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,140
will not sell okay so every day she's crying one day she met a monk a monk

48
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,640
asked her why are you always crying and then she told him what happened and the

49
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:44,320
monk said why don't you change your thoughts when it's raining wonderful oh

50
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:49,720
my older daughter's umbrella will sell right when it's sunny it's wonderful

51
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,240
ice cream will sell very well so when you'll be smiling

52
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:01,420
instead of crying every day it's all up to you how you determine your situation

53
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:07,180
so what you think is very important so if you train yourself to be positive and

54
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:12,820
get rid of all the negativity all the complaints and all the anger and hatred

55
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:17,140
and get rid of all of that because that will just create a bad life and bad

56
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:21,520
future for yourself it's not worth it so that's the first thing that you do the

57
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,840
second thing you do is you meditate.

58
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:30,400
When we are trying to meditate, we are trying to go outside of here.

59
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,400
It's not actually just cognitive thinking.

60
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,400
You are actually at a higher level of consciousness.

61
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,400
You are actually right up here.

62
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:46,400
You immediately touch your higher consciousness that is creating the universe.

63
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,400
You have the sea of your self-nature inside here.

64
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,400
You never tap into it.

65
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,400
That's why your self-nature is not coming out.

66
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,400
But if you meditate more, you will come here.

67
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,400
So some people will have psychic ability.

68
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,400
They can levitate. All these can happen.

69
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,400
Why? Because they are here.

70
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,400
They think at a much higher consciousness than we do.

71
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:17,400
So the key to studying the A consciousness is for us to change the way we think to be positive

72
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,400
and to meditate, to be in touch.

73
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,400
To be in touch with our own self-nature.

74
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,400
That's the class for today. Thank you for listening.
