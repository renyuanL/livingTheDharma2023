00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,240
Today we are going to talk about Guarding the Original True Mind from the 5th Patriarch of Zen Buddhism, Hong Ren.

2
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:29,240
He says the only thing we need to do is constantly guard our true nature.

3
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:34,240
It is talked about in terms of 4 questions and 4 answers.

4
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:40,240
1. How do we know Guarding the Original True Mind is the foundation of Nirvana?

5
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:48,240
The essence of Nirvana is silence and stillness, inaction and peace and bliss.

6
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,240
What is the essence of Nirvana?

7
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:57,240
It is silence when the mind is completely quiet and silent without wandering thoughts.

8
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:04,240
It is still, inaction, unmoved by any phenomenon or circumstances of life.

9
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:09,240
It is always in a state of peace, happiness, harmony and bliss.

10
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:17,240
This is the state of Nirvana, the cessation of suffering, the elimination of afflictions, enlightenment.

11
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,240
How do we reach this level of Nirvana?

12
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,240
It is through Guarding the Original True Mind.

13
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,240
As one's mind is the True Mind,

14
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,240
the illusion will be cut off.

15
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,240
Because the illusion is cut off,

16
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,240
one will have right thoughts.

17
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,240
Because one has right thoughts,

18
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,240
the wisdom of silence and illumination will be generated.

19
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,240
Because the wisdom of silence and illumination is generated,

20
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,240
one can completely realize the Dharma nature.

21
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,240
Because the complete realization of the Dharma nature,

22
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,240
Nirvana is attained.

23
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,240
So there are five steps here.

24
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,240
As we guard and stay with our true nature,

25
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,240
our delusions are cut off.

26
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,240
We will have no deluded thoughts.

27
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,240
And because of that,

28
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,240
we will have right thoughts,

29
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,240
right mindfulness.

30
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,240
For example,

31
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,240
if a mother,

32
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,240
her teenage son hasn't come home late at night,

33
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,240
she might be having a lot of wandering thoughts,

34
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,240
thinking he got into an accident or being robbed.

35
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,240
But all these

36
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,240
are not the right thoughts.

37
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,240
Someone is enlightened,

38
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,240
will stay calm and peaceful

39
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,240
without having suspicions and wandering thoughts.

40
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,240
And because we have right thoughts,

41
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,240
then we have this wisdom

42
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,240
of silence and illumination.

43
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,240
We can see everything clearly

44
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,240
without having emotional turmoil.

45
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,240
Because of the wisdom

46
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,240
and because we realize our true nature,

47
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,240
that is Nirvana.

48
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,240
So all these

49
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,240
is because

50
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,240
we are guarding the original true mind.

51
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,240
In the Shravagama Sutra,

52
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,240
Guanyin Bodhisattva says,

53
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,240
I entered the flow through hearing

54
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,240
and forgot all objective states.

55
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,240
He entered the flow of Nirvana,

56
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,240
or enlightenment,

57
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,240
by hearing.

58
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,240
When he hears,

59
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,240
he does not hear the sounds,

60
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,240
not the object of hearing

61
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,240
and what is being heard.

62
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,240
He only stays with his true nature.

63
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,240
That is how we reach Nirvana.

64
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,240
It's all through guarding our mind

65
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,240
and we can do it through

66
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,240
guarding our six senses.

67
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,240
Number two,

68
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,240
how do we know

69
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,240
guarding the original true mind

70
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,240
is the key to entering the way?

71
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,240
How do we enter the way to Buddhahood?

72
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,240
Again,

73
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,240
it's through guarding the original true mind.

74
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,240
If one paints the image

75
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,240
of a Buddha with all their power

76
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,240
and create lots of merits

77
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,240
like the sands of Ganges River,

78
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,240
these are only ways for Buddha

79
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,240
to teach our wise sentient beings

80
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,240
so they will create good karmas

81
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,240
for the future

82
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,240
and to plant crosses

83
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,240
to see Buddha in the future.

84
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,240
But these are not the right way.

85
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,240
The only way is to guard

86
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,240
our original true mind.

87
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,240
If one wants to reach Buddhahood earlier,

88
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,240
one would guard the original true mind.

89
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,240
If a person does not guard

90
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,240
the original true mind

91
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,240
and becomes a Buddha,

92
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,240
there is no such thing.

93
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,240
In conclusion,

94
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,240
take the mind in one place

95
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,240
and nothing can be accomplished.

96
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,240
Discipline the mind

97
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,240
so it listens to our order

98
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,240
like a servant.

99
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,240
We should be the owner,

100
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,240
the master of our mind.

101
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,240
So it does whatever we want it to do.

102
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,240
We think thoughts

103
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,240
that are positive,

104
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,240
that are good,

105
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,240
that are not deluded.

106
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,240
We are in control of our mind.

107
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,240
So train this mind

108
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,240
so it stays in one place.

109
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,240
Where is this place?

110
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,240
That is the original true mind.

111
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,240
That's the only place to be

112
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,240
in this peace and blissfulness state

113
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,240
that is silent and still.

114
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,240
If our mind can always stay constant

115
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,240
in this one place,

116
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,240
nothing can not be accomplished.

117
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,240
We can accomplish anything

118
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,240
when we have this meditative absorption.

119
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,240
We have focus,

120
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,240
we have concentration,

121
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,240
we have wisdom.

122
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,240
There is nothing you cannot do.

123
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,240
For example,

124
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,240
if you want to pray for a sick person

125
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,240
by chanting the Buddha's name

126
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,240
or the great compassion mantra

127
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,240
or sutra,

128
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,240
you give the merit to them,

129
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,240
you believe they will get the merit

130
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,240
and heal this person completely.

131
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,240
Number three,

132
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,240
how do we know guarding the original true mind

133
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,240
is the core of the 12 sutras?

134
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,240
The 12 sutras have different types of sutras.

135
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,240
Some are verses,

136
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,240
some are narratives,

137
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,240
some are past life accounts.

138
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,240
Different kinds of sutras

139
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,240
Buddha is trying to teach us

140
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,240
about sense and blessings,

141
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,240
about all the karmic causalities

142
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,240
and retributions

143
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,240
through boundless metaphors

144
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,240
to let us know our different desires,

145
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,240
create different things

146
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,240
of the world.

147
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,240
Buddha is trying to teach us

148
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,240
about one vehicle,

149
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,240
the single vehicle,

150
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,240
that our mind is the Buddha.

151
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,240
Our Buddha nature

152
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,240
is like the sun behind the clouds.

153
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,240
So if one clearly understands this

154
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,240
and always guards the original true mind,

155
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,240
the delusion cloud is eliminated

156
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,240
and the wisdom sun appears.

157
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,240
When you really guard the mind

158
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,240
and it's not really about

159
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,240
the sutra anymore.

160
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,240
When we have this wisdom,

161
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,240
why do we need more knowledge

162
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,240
about life and death

163
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,240
and all the principles of the sutra?

164
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,240
It's like a mirror.

165
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,240
When the dust is completely removed,

166
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,240
brightness will shine naturally.

167
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,240
We don't need to do anything else anymore.

168
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,240
If we carry an elusive mind

169
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,240
to learn a lot of sutra,

170
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,240
then that is still useless.

171
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,240
Always have the right thoughts

172
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,240
and be in a state of inactive mind.

173
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,240
That is true learning.

174
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,240
There's actually nothing else to learn

175
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,240
because both the I and Nirvana

176
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,240
are empty in nature

177
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,240
and it's already the original true mind.

178
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,240
Number four,

179
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,240
how do we know guarding

180
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,240
the original true mind

181
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,240
is the father of all the Buddhas

182
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,240
of the three times?

183
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,240
All Buddhas are born from mind nature,

184
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,240
original true mind.

185
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,240
If we can guard the original true mind first,

186
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,240
then we will not generate any delusive thoughts.

187
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,240
If delusive thoughts are not generated,

188
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,240
the duality of the mind is eliminated.

189
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,240
Then you can become a Buddha.

190
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,240
When we guard our true mind,

191
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,240
we will not have any delusive thoughts.

192
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,240
We will have no dualism in our mind.

193
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,240
The subject of the thinker

194
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,240
and the object we are thinking about

195
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,240
disappear.

196
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,240
Then we are really with our true nature.

197
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,240
That's when we become a Buddha.

198
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,240
Buddha is not elsewhere.

199
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,240
It's just when you are guarding

200
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,240
who you really are.

201
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,240
How do we know if we are staying

202
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,240
with our original true mind?

203
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,240
You can test yourself.

204
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,240
If you hear a great news about a person

205
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,240
who has harmed you,

206
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,240
undermined you,

207
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,240
insulted you,

208
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,240
and you feel a sense of sting

209
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,240
in your heart or sizzling,

210
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,240
that means you are still not there.

211
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,240
Our mind needs to be completely pure,

212
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,240
completely perfect,

213
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,240
full of love and joy.

214
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,240
If we are contaminated in our mind,

215
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,240
we are not guarding it.

216
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,240
Nobody can annoy you or hurt you

217
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,240
or come into your mind.

218
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,240
Do not give your power away to anybody

219
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,240
or anything.

220
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,240
Nothing can come into your life

221
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,240
except when you are giving them power.

222
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,240
So always guard and protect your mind.

223
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,240
Guard the original true mind.

224
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,240
Then you will reach nirvana.

225
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,240
You will enter the way.

226
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,240
You will understand all sutras.

227
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,240
And you will really reach Buddhahood.

228
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,240
So that's the class for today.

229
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,240
Thank you for listening.

230
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,240
Amitabha.
