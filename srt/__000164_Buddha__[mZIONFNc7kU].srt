1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,600
Today we are going to talk about

2
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:49,320
the three kinds of wisdom and the three kinds of enlightenment, so from here to there.

3
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,320
So there's actually three categories.

4
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:57,240
First, we're going to talk about general and all-knowledge wisdom.

5
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,240
So Buddha is someone who is wise.

6
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,840
Who knows the truth about the universe.

7
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,840
And what is the general and all-knowledge wisdom?

8
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,840
It's to know about the general truth about the whole universe.

9
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,840
Everything is impermanent.

10
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,840
Everything is forever changing.

11
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,840
Just like our body.

12
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,840
So with this wisdom, we will come to this self-enlightenment.

13
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,840
That there's not a thing as the self.

14
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,840
We call it non-self.

15
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,840
So what does it mean?

16
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,840
Why is non-self a wisdom?

17
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,840
When you understand that everything is forever changing,

18
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:48,840
and you let go of the idea of the ego and this identity of mind,

19
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,840
you actually will live a much happier life.

20
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,840
So that is called the general and all-knowledge wisdom.

21
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,840
So how do we apply this wisdom?

22
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,840
In everyday situations.

23
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,840
For example, last time we talked about Liao Fan.

24
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,840
How to become virtuous by having the virtue of humility.

25
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,840
By being humble.

26
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,840
A lot of us have the problem of being conceited.

27
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,840
Thinking we are better than others.

28
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,840
So if you let go of the idea of the self,

29
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,840
then you won't be conceited anymore.

30
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,840
There's not a me to be better than someone else.

31
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,840
So you give up the idea of the self.

32
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,840
You give up the idea of comparing.

33
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,840
When you compare to everyone else,

34
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,840
you'll come up with a lot of these ideas.

35
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,840
I'm better or he's better or who's better.

36
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,840
You lose your virtue of humility.

37
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,840
You actually become somewhat very full of yourself.

38
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,840
So by knowing that there's not an idea that's identified as me,

39
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,840
then you give up the idea of comparing.

40
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,840
You'll come into full peace with yourself and with everyone else.

41
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,840
For example, when you hear people say things that are not nice,

42
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,840
if you know that there's not a self,

43
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,840
who is he or she saying it to?

44
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,840
Right?

45
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,840
So who is it hurting?

46
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,840
The words, who is it hurting if there's not an idea of the self?

47
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,840
So if you let go of the self identity,

48
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,840
you will no longer be offended by anyone else.

49
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,840
That is true wisdom.

50
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,840
And also, we have the idea of ownership.

51
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,840
This is my house.

52
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,840
This is my mom.

53
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,840
This is my dad.

54
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,840
This is my car.

55
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,840
This is my belonging.

56
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,840
But if you know there is not a constant me

57
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,840
that is owning all these things,

58
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,840
then if you lose these things,

59
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,840
you will no longer be sad.

60
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,840
When you're fully at peace

61
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,840
and you don't base your happiness

62
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,840
on this ownership of things,

63
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,840
but you let go of the idea of me and I

64
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,840
and what do I own,

65
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,840
that way you will experience life in a much more happier way.

66
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,840
You will be a sage

67
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,840
because you're fully aware of letting go of the ego

68
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,840
and detached from worldly things.

69
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,840
When you come into this kind of wisdom,

70
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,840
we call it self enlightenment,

71
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,840
which is letting go of the idea of the self.

72
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,840
And when you are practicing this kind of enlightenment,

73
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,840
we call it the Theravada Buddhism.

74
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,840
When you reach this level of understanding,

75
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,840
you are called an Arhat.

76
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,840
An Arhat is someone who reaches this level of enlightenment.

77
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,840
They no longer have to be in the sixth realm of reincarnation.

78
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,840
Their wisdom has already let go of the idea of the self,

79
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,840
so they no longer have to reincarnate.

80
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,840
Or you can become a Prayaga Buddha

81
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,840
who is also realizing the idea

82
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,840
that things are forever changing,

83
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,840
so there is not a constant me

84
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,840
that should be attached to.

85
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,840
This is the first kind of wisdom

86
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,840
that is the foundation

87
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,840
of all Buddhism.

88
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,840
The second wisdom is called

89
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,840
differentiation wisdom.

90
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,840
So first, you come into wisdom

91
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,840
and knowledge about the world

92
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,840
which is all impermanent

93
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,840
and there is no idea of the self.

94
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,840
Now you focus your wisdom

95
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,840
on differentiating everyone else.

96
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,840
Not just you become enlightened,

97
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,840
you want to help everyone else around you

98
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,840
become enlightened.

99
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,840
So it's called differentiation.

100
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,840
That means knowing everyone's difference.

101
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,840
Everything is impermanent,

102
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,840
everything is changing,

103
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,840
but you want to know how everyone is different.

104
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,840
For example, some people like to eat rice,

105
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,840
some people like to eat noodles,

106
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,840
some people like to eat buns.

107
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,840
Everybody is different,

108
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,840
so you give people what they want.

109
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,840
Then they will listen to you

110
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,840
and learn the Dharma

111
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,840
and become enlightened.

112
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,840
To know and understand everyone

113
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,840
is a very big wisdom.

114
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,840
So we call it differentiation wisdom.

115
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,840
When you come to this kind of enlightenment,

116
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,840
it's called the enlightenment of the self and others.

117
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,840
Not only you know about your own self,

118
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,840
you now help others become enlightened

119
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,840
and help them let go of their ego

120
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,840
and get out of their incarnation.

121
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,840
So we call this kind of Buddhism

122
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,840
Mahayana Buddhism.

123
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,840
It's mainly about compassion.

124
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,840
When you practice this kind of Mahayana Buddhism,

125
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,840
you are now called a Bodhisattva.

126
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,840
A Bodhisattva is someone that's always helping others

127
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,840
to become enlightened.

128
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,840
There was an abbot, a monk.

129
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,840
One day he had to go outside of his temple

130
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,840
to do some errands.

131
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,840
On the way back,

132
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,840
it started raining really, really hard.

133
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,840
He tried to find a place so he can rest.

134
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,840
So he came to a big mansion,

135
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,840
you know, this rich person's mansion,

136
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,840
and he knocked on the door

137
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,840
and asked the servant,

138
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,840
may I please come in,

139
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,840
just for a little,

140
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,840
until the rain stops?

141
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,840
But the servant said,

142
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,840
oh, I'm sorry,

143
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,840
the owner,

144
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,840
you know, this rich person,

145
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,840
he really hates monks,

146
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,840
so you better just go.

147
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,840
And he said,

148
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,840
can I just please stand by the roof

149
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,840
just for a little while

150
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,840
until the rain stops?

151
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,840
He said,

152
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,840
oh, let me go in and ask.

153
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,840
So he went in to ask

154
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,840
and the servant comes back and said,

155
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,840
no, I'm sorry,

156
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,840
he asked you to leave right now.

157
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,840
So the abbot,

158
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,840
okay,

159
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,840
can you just please tell me the name

160
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,840
of this owner?

161
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,840
So the servant told him the name

162
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,840
and the abbot went away.

163
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,840
Three years later,

164
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,840
this rich person,

165
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,840
he got a wife.

166
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,840
This young wife really loved

167
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,840
to learn Buddhism.

168
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,840
The rich person,

169
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,840
he can help this wife of his

170
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,840
to learn a lot of Buddhism.

171
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,840
So this wife said,

172
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,840
can you take me to this temple nearby?

173
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,840
I want to go there.

174
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,840
So one day he took the wife

175
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,840
to see this temple.

176
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,840
And when he went inside,

177
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,840
much to his surprise,

178
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,840
he saw his name

179
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,840
a tag in the front of the statue.

180
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,840
And he asked the little monk,

181
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,840
why is that name up there

182
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,840
on the shrine?

183
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,840
And he said,

184
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,840
oh, because three years ago,

185
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,840
my abbot went out

186
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,840
and he said this rich person

187
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,840
really does not like him.

188
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,840
He put his name up

189
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,840
so he would pray for him

190
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,840
every day for three years.

191
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,840
And that's why he would have

192
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,840
good affinity with this person

193
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,840
for the rest of his life.

194
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,840
The rich person came full realization

195
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,840
that he should change his way

196
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,840
and start learning Buddhism.

197
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,840
So this monk,

198
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,840
he did not get upset.

199
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,840
He tried to help him

200
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,840
and put his name up

201
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,840
and pray for him for three years.

202
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,840
That is called Mahayana Buddhism,

203
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,840
where you really, really care

204
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,840
about the well-being of others.

205
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,840
Okay, and the third kind of wisdom

206
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,840
is called overall perfect wisdom.

207
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,840
This is basically the combination

208
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,840
of the first two.

209
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,840
The first one is general wisdom

210
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,840
about the impermanence

211
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,840
of the entire universe.

212
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,840
And let go of the idea of the self.

213
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,840
And then you put your wisdom

214
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,840
to know all other sentient beings

215
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,840
and to help them.

216
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,840
If you can balance between this wisdom

217
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,840
and the differential wisdom,

218
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,840
it becomes the overall perfect wisdom.

219
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,840
When you come into this wisdom,

220
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,840
it's called the perfect complete enlightenment.

221
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,840
And you become a Buddha.

222
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,840
So this is a perfect person

223
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,840
with perfect compassion and enlightenment.

224
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,840
And there's a fast way

225
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,840
to reach this Buddhahood.

226
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,840
It's called single vehicle Buddhism.

227
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,840
That means when you are fully aware

228
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,840
that innately you are born as a Buddha.

229
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,840
Like you have the Buddha nature inside of you.

230
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,840
This is not like what you learn

231
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,840
or you have to work hard at it.

232
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,840
You are born as a Buddha.

233
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,840
In the beginning,

234
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,840
you already have the general

235
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,840
and all knowledge wisdom.

236
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,840
You have the differential wisdom.

237
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,840
You have the overall perfect wisdom

238
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,840
inside of you to begin with.

239
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,840
So why can't you become a Buddha?

240
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,840
Everyone is a Buddha.

241
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,840
It's called single vehicle.

242
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,840
One car becoming Buddhahood.

243
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,840
And the Lotus Sutra,

244
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,840
which is the most important sutra in Buddhism,

245
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,840
it talks about the daughter of the Naga King.

246
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,840
So Naga is the sea world.

247
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,840
One time,

248
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,840
Manjuri Bodhisattva,

249
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,840
he went to the water world

250
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,840
to help them become enlightened.

251
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,840
In this Lotus Flower Sutra assembly,

252
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,840
all the Buddha and Bodhisattvas

253
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,840
are sitting around

254
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,840
and they asked Bodhisattva Manjushri,

255
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,840
When you went to the palace of the Naga King,

256
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,840
did you help anyone become enlightened?

257
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,840
And he said,

258
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,840
Yeah, I helped the daughter of the Naga King.

259
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,840
She is only eight years old,

260
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,840
but she has the perfect wisdom

261
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,840
and she loves all sentient beings

262
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,840
as if they are her own children.

263
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,840
Immediately enlightened.

264
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,840
And she's only an eight-year-old girl.

265
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,840
And everyone in the assembly don't believe.

266
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,840
The daughter of the Naga King,

267
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,840
she appeared in the assembly.

268
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,840
She offered a jewel of hers to the Buddha.

269
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,840
Buddha accept her jewel.

270
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,840
And then she asked everyone,

271
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,840
Is this done quickly?

272
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,840
That I give this offer and Buddha accept.

273
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,840
And they're like,

274
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,840
Yeah, this is done very quickly.

275
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,840
Then she said,

276
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,840
You watch me become a Buddha more quickly than this.

277
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,840
So all of a sudden,

278
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,840
everybody see her.

279
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,840
She transformed into a man standing on a lotus flower,

280
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,840
went to the south world and became a Buddha.

281
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,840
So what does that mean?

282
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,840
That means everybody has the Buddha nature inside of them.

283
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,840
That's why this eight-year-old girl,

284
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,840
instantly she become enlightened.

285
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,840
How does she do that?

286
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,840
Because she know she has the Buddha nature inside of her.

287
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,840
We all got to be confident that we are all Buddha to begin with.

288
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,840
Now you know you have the three kinds of wisdom inside of you.

289
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,840
And you can reach the three kinds of enlightenment.

290
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,840
Now that you know that you are a Buddha to begin with.

291
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,840
And you cultivate heart.

292
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,840
And sure enough,

293
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,840
you will reach Buddhahood.

294
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,840
That's the lesson for today.

295
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,840
Thank you for listening.

296
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,840
Om Nitha Foh.
