00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:35,760
Today we're going to talk about the ten farmer grounds, the ten places that we physically

3
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,160
exist in. The ten places or ten conditions, the ten worlds that we create for ourselves.

4
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:47,200
Why is it called Dharma Round? Because Dharma is what we call everything. And this everything

5
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:53,540
is created by our minds. That's why it's called Dharma Round. So it's all created by us. From

6
00:00:53,540 --> 00:01:01,440
the bottom to the top, there are ten places. The first is called hell. Who creates hell?

7
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,740
Hell is when you're very angry all the time. Or you're depressed. Or you're feeling very

8
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:10,920
bad. Or you have a lot of negative emotions. This is a place where we're very miserable.

9
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,240
And you feel like you're in the present. Even when you're living as a person, you can be

10
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:22,260
in hell because of your emotions. You live in a beautiful place. You live in a mansion.

11
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:29,320
But your heart is full of turmoil and depression. Then you're still in hell. So hell is created

12
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:35,720
by yourself. The second is called Hungry Ghost Round. The Hungry Ghost World is when we're

13
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:42,140
very selfish. We're always desiring things for ourselves. You're always thinking of what

14
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:48,540
do I get? A craving. And you're all constantly dominated by this feeling of craving for things.

15
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:55,180
The third is the Animal Round. So you say, why is animal not good? No, they're so cute.

16
00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:00,800
Animals, they can reason. They can think. They're kind of ignorant. They can think

17
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,080
like humans. We have the ability to reason and have a lot

18
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:11,140
of reason and think logically. Animals follow their instinct. They have a lot of sexual

19
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:18,000
behavior. They just follow whatever they're craving. When we are very emotional, we are

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,220
in the Animal Round. When we're just constantly being very ignorant and foolish and living

21
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:30,480
by our instinct. The more craving you have, the more selfish you are, the less happy you

22
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,540
will be. So these three rounds are the non-virtuous

23
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,540
rounds.

24
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:40,080
The bad rounds. And these three are the virtuous or good rounds.

25
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:46,360
So the fourth round is called the Asura Round. Asura Round, they do good deeds, but they're

26
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,600
always jealous of others. They do good deeds, but they want to be number one. Number one

27
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:57,560
on whatever good deed they're doing. So that is still a good round, but it's not perfect

28
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:03,200
because you have a lot of jealousy of others doing better than you are. If you're always

29
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,360
jealous of others, you lose.

30
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:09,080
You live here. You're always jealous of others.

31
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:15,540
And the fifth is the Human Round. Human World. We are physically in the human world right

32
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:22,660
now. Human is a mixture of good deeds and bad deeds. Sometimes we are good, sometimes

33
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:28,900
we're bad. The good thing about humans is we can reflect and we can change our ways.

34
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:35,080
A lot of other rounds, they can do that. We are the only one that can really improve ourselves

35
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:41,520
and become a Buddha. We become a true enlightened being. The human round is actually the best

36
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:46,860
round to cultivate. Because we have a lot of tragedies and difficulties in our lives

37
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,040
too, but we also have a lot of wonderful experiences too.

38
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:55,440
The last good round is the Heaven. The heavenly beings, they're very compassionate. They always

39
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,980
think for others, help others. They're full of loving kindness and always do things for

40
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,360
others. So if you're always kind and loving, you live in a good life.

41
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:04,460
Thank you.

42
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:10,140
And then the heavenly round, the Heaven. You're in the Heaven. So these are the six rounds

43
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:17,400
of reincarnation. When you die, next lifetime, you can go to any one of these rounds. But

44
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:24,800
if you cultivate Buddhism, you can go up to even higher and get out of the reincarnation.

45
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,320
These four are the rounds of sages and enlightened beings.

46
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:35,320
The seventh is called Arhats, or Sound, Hear, Arhats. They are ones that really help you

47
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:41,640
to be a Buddha. They really learn the Buddhism, understand the impermanence of life, and they

48
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:48,700
let go of the idea of self. They let go of their ego. They're no longer having their

49
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:56,620
own desire, their own emotion, and everything about themselves. They let go of the idea

50
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:01,200
of personhood and their ego, and become Arhats. The next one is the Pratyekabuddha. They're

51
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,980
like the Arhats. They're like the Arhats, they'll be self-paritié. They have to be

52
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:04,980
self-paritié. They're like the Arhats. They're like the Arhats. They're like the Arhats. They're

53
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:12,560
But they don't need to listen, but listening to the teaching of Buddhism. They can become enlightened by themselves

54
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,960
Just by looking at the trees looking at the mountains and they realize oh everything is changing

55
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,180
Everything is impermanent

56
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:26,720
Everything is based on cost condition and there's not a selfish me that's inside of this thing

57
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,800
So they become completely aware and realize the true nature of the universe

58
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:39,900
So they are called the Pandayaka Buddha become fully realized. These two they only focus on their own

59
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,340
Practice they don't try to help others to become enlightened

60
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:49,560
But Bodhisattva not only do they want to have enlightenment for themselves

61
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:56,160
They want other people to be enlightened. They want to help others to come into full enlightenment

62
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,380
Okay, so they help others. Last one is the Buddha round

63
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,720
This is the combination

64
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,920
of

65
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,620
Our hats and because they come to self realization about themselves

66
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:16,240
They also help others when you're in the perfect complete balance between these two you become the Buddha

67
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,160
because you have the complete wisdom and the complete

68
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:29,560
Compassion that is perfect and supreme and then you become a Buddha all of us have the quality of

69
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,220
the ten rounds inside of us

70
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,120
We all have the potential to live in this ten rounds to fully

71
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,780
understand all

72
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:46,400
Buddha's of the three periods of time to fully understand what is a Buddha Buddha is basically a person

73
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,340
if Buddha is not a god

74
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,960
anyone can be a Buddha so for the three periods of time the past and the

75
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,120
present and the future

76
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,800
So you want to know how do the past present or future Buddha came about?

77
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,680
you have to continue

78
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:09,720
the nature of the dharma realm. You have to understand what's the nature of these ten

79
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:18,720
places. The nature is everything is created from the mind. So what's the true nature?

80
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:26,720
All these are created by your mind. You have ten doors. Which door you want to open, it's

81
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,720
up to you. Buddha still live in this world, do everyday activity, still go to work and

82
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,720
still have family. But it's just they are full of compassion and wisdom and let go of

83
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:44,720
the idea of the self. And they are a Buddha. Full of compassion, courage, love, life force

84
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,720
and creativity. But they are just normal person. You have the potential to be a Buddha all

85
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,720
the time. As long as you contemplate on the idea that you have the Buddha nature. All

86
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,720
you have to do is contemplate on the fact that I am a Buddha. I have Buddha nature.

87
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,720
So when I deal with everybody around me, I want to be compassionate. I want to let go

88
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,720
of my anger. I don't want to be greedy, foolish. I don't want to be in other realms. Because

89
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:21,720
I create my own Buddhahood. One realm contains all other realms. For example, I am a human

90
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,720
right now. But if I always think about helping others to become a Buddha, I don't want to

91
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:33,720
become enlightened. Then I am a human, what? Bodhisattva. I am a human but I always think

92
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:41,720
about helping others. But if I am always fighting, always angry, then I am a human's what?

93
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:49,720
Hell. One contains the other nine. But it's up to you to always choose to be in the higher

94
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:56,720
world. There is a French man. He works in a department store. One day he was fired because

95
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,720
he had no job in his poor. His wife took the kid and left him. So he felt like it's the

96
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,720
end of the world. He wanted to commit suicide. He talked to his best friend. I am going to

97
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,720
kill myself because I feel life is meaningless. I am at the bottom of my life. It's meaningless.

98
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,720
I want to kill myself. And his friend told him, I know this great psychic. Maybe you

99
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,720
should go to the psychic first. You know, he can tell you something about your life.

100
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,720
So he went to the psychic and the psychic told him, you know, last lifetime you were

101
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,720
Napoleon. And you can do great things. You'll be very successful whatever you're doing.

102
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,720
And then he said, oh, I am Napoleon. Okay. So he decided not to kill himself. And he

103
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,720
started working. He said, I am Napoleon. Every day he kept telling himself he is Napoleon.

104
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:49,720
And then he started looking for another job in the department store. And now he is the

105
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:56,720
owner of the largest department store in France. How does this come about? Was he really Napoleon?

106
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,720
In his last life? We don't know. But he thought he is. And then he changed his life.

107
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,720
It's all up to you to change your life just by how you think. If you think I am a Buddha,

108
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,720
then I am a Buddha. Nothing else will interfere with you of your dreams. And you can make

109
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,720
all your dreams come true and live a joyful life. Okay. So that's the class for today.

110
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,720
Thank you for listening. Amitabha.
