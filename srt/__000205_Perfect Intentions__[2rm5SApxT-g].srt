1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,980
If you want to understand all Buddhas of all times, just observe the nature of Dharma rounds.

2
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,380
So what's the nature of the universe?

3
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,980
We call it Dharma rounds.

4
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,380
Everything is actually made from our mind.

5
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:47,080
Quantum physics has proven every matter is just a vibration from the energy of our thoughts.

6
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,280
In Buddhism, we call it karmic effect.

7
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,480
So our good thoughts create heaven.

8
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,480
Our bad thoughts create hell.

9
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,880
That's why our thoughts are very important.

10
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:05,080
What you think about all day long is what you create for the world.

11
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:10,480
Today we're going to talk about the Bodhisattvas' way of thinking.

12
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,880
What's their perfect intentions?

13
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,180
There are three general intentions of the Bodhisattvas.

14
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,680
The first is enthusiasm.

15
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,380
We have to have great enthusiasm when we do good deeds.

16
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,680
In the Lotus Sutra, it says,

17
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,780
Even children in play,

18
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:39,080
who make Buddhas stupas out of heaps of sand or draw a Buddha's image with a blade of grass,

19
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,880
all of them have reached Buddhahood.

20
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,380
That small act of kindness because of the enthusiasm.

21
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,880
Because of the sincerity, it made them into Buddhas.

22
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,180
So have enthusiasm when we do good deeds.

23
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,880
The second is rejoice.

24
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,680
This is for ourselves.

25
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,380
This is with others.

26
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,080
Rejoice in other people's kindness.

27
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,780
Let go of ourselves.

28
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,380
Do not compare or be jealous when other people are doing great deeds.

29
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,880
If we rejoice and recognize and praise their good deeds,

30
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,980
you're actually changing the world.

31
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:19,280
So that's the Bodhisattva's second perfect intention.

32
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,080
The third is happiness.

33
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,980
Enthusiasm is for ourselves.

34
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,680
Rejoice is rejoice for the others.

35
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,080
And happiness is praying.

36
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,280
You're always wishing.

37
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:33,880
That everybody will keep doing good deeds and reach Buddhahood.

38
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:43,080
So that's the three general perfect intentions of a Bodhisattva on their way to reach Buddhahood.

39
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,980
These three perfect intentions, they have six characteristics.

40
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,380
The first is boundlessness.

41
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:56,680
There's no limit to how many people you want to save or want to help.

42
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,080
You don't just love your own family.

43
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,880
You love your country.

44
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:06,380
You should extend your love and compassion to all sentient beings.

45
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:11,780
We have this organization called Doctors Without Borders.

46
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:19,780
They go to all countries in need and give medical service to casualties of war, to refugees.

47
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:26,180
And now with the coronavirus, without any consideration of country or money,

48
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,080
they just do it out of the goodness of their heart.

49
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:33,180
That's in the intention of a Bodhisattva.

50
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,380
Boundless intention without any limit.

51
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,980
The second one is endless.

52
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,880
There should be no time limit to how long you want to do this kindness.

53
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,480
My favorite story is about a bird in the forest.

54
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,080
One day, there was a big fire.

55
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,880
The bird was very nervous and very worried.

56
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,080
So he darted to the river, dipped himself in the water,

57
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,480
and flew back quickly to the raging fire,

58
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,680
shook his wings really hard,

59
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,880
trying to release a few drops of water that was still on his feathers.

60
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,180
But how much good can that do?

61
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,780
He kept doing it regardless for hours.

62
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,080
Soon, the heaven, they know,

63
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,480
wow, there is a bird doing such a great deed.

64
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,180
The heavenly being came down and asked,

65
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,580
what do you think you're doing?

66
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,880
Do you think you can really put out the fire by doing this?

67
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,880
And the bird said, I don't care.

68
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,080
Even if I die, I will still come alive.

69
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,180
I will keep doing this until it's put out.

70
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,280
The heavenly being was so touched,

71
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,280
it started raining and extinguished the fire.

72
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,780
Who is this bird?

73
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,980
It's Buddha Shakyamuni.

74
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,280
So our compassion should be endless.

75
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,680
The third is called joyfulness.

76
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,480
A lot of moms, they're always complaining.

77
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,480
Nobody is cleaning up in this household,

78
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,580
except me.

79
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,280
What would they do without me?

80
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,280
Always frustrated doing everything in the house,

81
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,580
but very unhappy about everybody.

82
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,480
That's not the way to be a bodhisattva,

83
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,280
just by doing housework.

84
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,280
Happily, joyfully, you create great merit.

85
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,280
That's the bodhisattva's way, creates great karma.

86
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,180
When you're joyful, you change the atmosphere,

87
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,980
you change the vibration,

88
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,980
you change the energy in your family.

89
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,380
Always be cheerful,

90
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,180
and without any complaints.

91
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,580
The fourth one is repaying kindness.

92
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,280
When we're doing other people's service,

93
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,280
don't think we are doing them a favor.

94
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,380
Actually, you should think they've done us great deeds

95
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,880
by letting us helping them.

96
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,380
Be appreciative,

97
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,380
as if they're your great benefactors.

98
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,880
There was a hotel attendant,

99
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,780
one stormy night,

100
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,680
the hotel is completely packed.

101
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,180
There came an old couple,

102
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,280
trying to get a room.

103
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,480
But the hotel attendant told the old couple,

104
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,880
I'm sorry, every room is occupied,

105
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,280
it's fully booked.

106
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,980
But he didn't want the old couple to go out in the storm again,

107
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,380
and have no place to stay.

108
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,780
So the hotel attendant told the old couple,

109
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,180
if you guys don't mind,

110
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,980
you can stay in my room.

111
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,980
Since I'm gonna be working here at the counter all night anyways,

112
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,780
the old man gladly accepted the offer,

113
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,080
went to this room,

114
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,980
and had a great night of sleep.

115
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,780
In the morning,

116
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,980
they went to the counter to check out and pay for the room.

117
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,280
The hotel attendant said,

118
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,080
no, thank you for letting me help you.

119
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,580
I'm glad you had a great night of sleep.

120
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,680
I feel great.

121
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,680
So there's no need to pay.

122
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,280
The old couple was very appreciative,

123
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,380
and they left.

124
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,180
Couple years later,

125
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,480
this hotel attendant received a letter from the old man,

126
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,680
please come to New York,

127
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,880
with the attached flight ticket,

128
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,380
and come to this address.

129
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,380
I will meet you over there.

130
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,780
The young man went to New York,

131
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,280
and it was the address of a big, huge hotel.

132
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,380
The old man said to him,

133
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,480
I bought this hotel for you.

134
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,680
With your service attitude,

135
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,680
I know you will be a great hotel manager,

136
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,780
and a great hotel owner.

137
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,980
That was a true story.

138
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,480
When you do everything out of kindness,

139
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,680
with the intention of paying back other people's kindness,

140
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,480
that is Bodhisattva's way of doing all the good deeds.

141
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,480
So be glad other people are letting you serve.

142
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,380
The fifth one is aspiring intention.

143
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,780
Bodhisattva always have great vows,

144
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,180
really want to help all sentient beings.

145
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,280
Their vows are grand and without any limits.

146
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,480
The most well-known,

147
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,580
Bodhisattva is Earth Treasure Bodhisattva.

148
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,680
Why is he called the Earth Treasure?

149
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,280
Because his heart is like the earth,

150
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,680
that nourishes all beings.

151
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,080
It's impartial,

152
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,880
it's grand,

153
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,680
and it can store everything.

154
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,380
Everybody who believes in him,

155
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,880
will get the treasure of the earth.

156
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,280
What was his vow?

157
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,980
Until the hells are empty,

158
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:23,080
I will never become a Buddha.

159
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,480
So everybody is safe out of hell.

160
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:25,980
Then,

161
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,480
I will reach Buddhahood.

162
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,680
What kind of compassion is that?

163
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,580
That's inconceivable,

164
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:35,680
but that's the kind of intention of a Bodhisattva.

165
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,480
If you have this kind of intention,

166
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,380
you will soon reach Buddhahood.

167
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,680
The sixth one is pure intention.

168
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,880
Not do good deeds,

169
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,880
so I have something in return.

170
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,380
I'll have good karma,

171
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,280
something good will happen to me.

172
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,880
No, you always have pure intention,

173
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,080
no motive,

174
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,880
except to help the person,

175
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,480
reach Buddhahood.

176
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:03,480
So these are the six intentions of a Bodhisattva.

177
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,880
We should be enthusiastic

178
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,680
when we are having these six intentions.

179
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,480
We should rejoice when other people

180
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,480
are having these six intentions.

181
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,480
And we should happily pray

182
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,580
that all beings will have these six intentions

183
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,380
and reach Buddhahood.

184
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,680
I want to end with a verse from the

185
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,480
universal worthy Bodhisattva.

186
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,480
My boundless compassion is endless.

187
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,480
Thought succeeds thought without interruption

188
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,480
and in bodily, vocal, and mental deeds

189
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,480
without weariness.

190
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,480
My boundless compassion

191
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,480
or vows

192
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,480
or good deeds

193
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,480
or love

194
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,480
is endless.

195
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,480
It's forever.

196
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,480
Thoughts after thoughts

197
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,980
without interruption.

198
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,980
Forever and consistently.

199
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,480
And in bodily, vocal, and mental deeds.

200
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,980
The actions that I do,

201
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,480
the words I say,

202
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,980
the thoughts I have,

203
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,480
they all align with this kind of virtue.

204
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,980
Without weariness,

205
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,980
I will never be tired.

206
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,980
With this great compassion,

207
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,480
with the good deeds I'm doing.

208
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,980
If you live this life

209
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,480
with these kind of

210
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,480
perfect intention,

211
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,480
you are a Bodhisattva.

212
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,480
You will change lives.

213
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,980
You will inspire everybody you meet.

214
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,980
You will touch other people's heart.

215
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,480
And you will definitely

216
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,980
be on the way

217
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,480
to reach Buddhahood.

218
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,480
So that's the class for today.

219
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,480
Thank you for listening.

220
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,480
Aum To Fo.
