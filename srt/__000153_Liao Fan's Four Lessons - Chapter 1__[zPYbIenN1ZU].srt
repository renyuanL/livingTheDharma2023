1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,000
16 Years ago, when my eyes were blinded by the light of the sun, I looked up to the sky, and I saw the stars, and I saw the stars, and I saw the stars, and I saw the stars, and I saw the stars.

2
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:36,000
16 years ago, when my eyes became bad because of retinal disease, I lost my central vision, I was devastated.

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I don't know what to do with my life, and I started learning Buddhism.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I didn't know anything about Buddhism, but I came to this monk explaining this book, Liao Fang's Four Lessons.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
This is the book that transformed my life.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Today, I'm going to share with you about this book,

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and hopefully, you will come to realization and change your life for the better.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
There are four chapters to this book.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The first chapter is the first lesson, learning to change destiny.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And the second chapter is how to reform, how to change our ways.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The third chapter is how to cultivate all the goodness, to maintain your prosperity and goodness.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And the fourth is to develop the virtue of humility.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Be humble. Humble will make you prosperous and keep what you have.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Today, we are going to just talk about the first lesson,

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and then the next week, we will talk about the second, the third, and the fourth.

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So the first lesson is learning to change destiny.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
There is this person named Liao Fang.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
When he was young, he lost his dad because his dad got sick and passed away, so he lived with his mom.

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
His mom wanted him to study medicine, so he didn't take the scholarly route.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
He didn't want to be a government official.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
He just wanted to do herbal medicine.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
One day, he was on the street trying to find herbal medicine.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
He met this man, Mr. Kong.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
He's a psychic. He knows what's going on.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And Mr. Kong said,

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You know, you are supposed to be a government official.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
How come you are not studying?

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
He said, Oh, because my mom wanted me to be a herbal doctor to heal people.

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Liao Fang took this man back to his house to see his mom.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And his mom asked Mr. Kong,

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Do you know whatever happened to him when he was little?

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
This man told them exactly what happened to him when his dad passed away.

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
He knew everything by calculation.

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So like, Oh, wow, you're great.

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Can you predict his future?

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What is his future going to be?

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Mr. Kong said he will place 14th next year on the county exam.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And he will place 71st on the provincial test.

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And then he will place the 9th next year.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And he said, You're going to have no children.

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And you will die when you are 53.

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
On August 14th, between 1 to 3 a.m.

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So he knew the exact time of his death.

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So everything was calculated.

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And then next year, he took the exam.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It was exactly what Mr. Kong said.

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
He placed exactly.

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And he knew,

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yeah, there is destiny.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It is determined.

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So from 17 to 37,

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
he just followed his destiny.

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
He didn't do anything.

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
He didn't try hard.

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He didn't do anything.

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
He just go on with life.

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
When he was 37,

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
before he went to Nanjing to study at a university,

59
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
he went to see a Zen master.

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And when he was there,

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
he meditated with the Zen master for three days and three nights.

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And the Zen master was like,

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Wow, you know, normal people,

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
they have so much wandering thoughts.

65
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
They cannot sit here still.

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That's why they cannot be a sage.

67
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
How come you have no wandering thoughts?

68
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And he said to the Zen master,

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Because my life is already destined.

70
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What is there to think about?

71
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
There is nothing to think about.

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I have no wandering thoughts.

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And the Zen master started laughing.

74
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
He said,

75
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Oh, I thought you were someone with great capability.

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You were just a normal person bound by fate.

77
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Then Liao Fan was like,

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Do you mean fate can be changed?

79
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And then the Zen master was like,

80
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
We can recreate our own destiny and seek good fortune.

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Anyone can recreate whatever was destined.

82
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
We have destined life because what we did in our prior lives,

83
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
all the good deeds and bad deeds,

84
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
whatever happened to you today is no coincidence.

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Who you marry,

86
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
which family and what your job is,

87
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
even like a cup of water and a bowl of rice,

88
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
everything you have today is based on what you did before.

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That's why we can calculate your destiny.

90
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It is fixed,

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
but it has variables.

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
What's the variable?

93
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What you do today,

94
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
your thoughts.

95
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
If you're good and virtuous,

96
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
you can totally change whatever is destined.

97
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The master explained this to Liao Fan.

98
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
He's like,

99
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Oh, really?

100
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I can understand if I change my way and I have good integrity,

101
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I have virtue,

102
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
that I can control.

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
But how can I control if I have good position,

104
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
if I have good family and the outside experience,

105
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
how can I control that?

106
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The master told him,

107
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
all the fields of merit are within one's own heart.

108
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
If one seeks from the true mind within,

109
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
one can be in touch with all that one wishes for.

110
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
All the fields of merit,

111
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
our heart is like a field of merit,

112
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
like a farmer.

113
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Whatever you want to cultivate,

114
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
you can have a harvest.

115
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You can only go from within one's heart.

116
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You don't go try to compete with others

117
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
and be greedy

118
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
and try to change all the circumstances.

119
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
If you want to live a good life from within,

120
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
change your own way and be virtuous

121
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
and have good integrity

122
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
and do all that is good,

123
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
then you will reap what you sow.

124
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
If one seeks from the true mind,

125
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
basically your true self nature within,

126
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
then you will be in touch with everything that you wish for.

127
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
If you want a son,

128
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
if you want a promotion,

129
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
if you want to be a millionaire,

130
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
if you want to be proud,

131
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
you can do anything.

132
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
If you go inside,

133
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
if you just go inside and change your thoughts,

134
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
then you can change your entire life.

135
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And he said,

136
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
to permanently accord with the mind of heaven

137
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
and to seek our own great good fortune.

138
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
What you do is very easy.

139
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You want to be permanently accord with the mind of heaven.

140
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
What is the mind of heaven?

141
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
We say the universal power.

142
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The universe is full of positivity.

143
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's full of positivity and virtue and goodness.

144
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You want to be in line with the universe.

145
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So you want to do all that is good.

146
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Get rid of all your bad ways

147
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
and do all that is good.

148
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Then you will be able to change your destiny.

149
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So the master asked him,

150
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
do you think you deserve to be an imperial appointed government official?

151
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Do you think you deserve it?

152
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Lao Fan is very honest.

153
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
He thought about it and he said,

154
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
oh no, I'm very impatient and I'm very narrow minded.

155
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I always boast about myself and put other people down.

156
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So I don't deserve to be a leader or to be a government official.

157
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
The master asked,

158
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
do you think you deserve to have a lot of children?

159
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And he's like,

160
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
um, no, I don't think I do

161
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
because I am obsessed with cleaning this.

162
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
When the water is too clean and harbors no fish,

163
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm very quick tempered.

164
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And I'm very selfish.

165
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I only think about myself and my own reputation.

166
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I don't care about others.

167
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I don't take care of myself.

168
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So I stay up late every night and I drink a lot of alcohol.

169
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And I talk a lot.

170
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So I don't save my energy.

171
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So I don't think I should have children.

172
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
He was able to reflect on his own fault.

173
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And the master said,

174
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
since you know that you have all these faults,

175
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
if you change it,

176
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
then you will change your destiny.

177
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So what happened was after that day,

178
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
he totally realized,

179
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
oh, I can change my destiny.

180
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
From that day on,

181
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
he vowed he would do 3,000 good deeds.

182
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So every day he has a book

183
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
and he writes down all the good deeds and all the bad deeds.

184
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The first 3,000 deeds,

185
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
he wants to pass the government exam.

186
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The next year when he did the exam,

187
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
he did more than whatever Mr. Kong calculated.

188
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It was much more.

189
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
He passed with flying colors.

190
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But that took him more than 10 years

191
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
to complete the 3,000 good deeds.

192
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Then he decided,

193
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
oh, I'm going to do not just 3,000 good deeds.

194
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm going to wish for a son.

195
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
That only took him four years.

196
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And his wife got pregnant.

197
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And he really got a son.

198
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And he said,

199
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
oh, I'm going to keep going.

200
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm going to vow to become a government official

201
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
and pass the highest level of government exam.

202
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
After three years,

203
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
he really did and became a mayor of a county.

204
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And he said,

205
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
oh, but I'm not done with my 10,000 good deeds

206
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
because now I live in the government residence.

207
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
There are not much good deeds to do

208
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
because I don't see a lot of people.

209
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
One night in the dream,

210
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
a heavenly being came and told him,

211
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
you know, your 10,000 good deeds is already complete

212
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
because we reduced the taxes by half

213
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
for all the farmers.

214
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So that is worth 10,000 good deeds.

215
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's already done.

216
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
He woke up and knew that the 10,000 good deeds

217
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
are already done.

218
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So his life is completely changed

219
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
when he started doing good.

220
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
He lived to be 74

221
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
instead of 53.

222
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And he had a son

223
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
and he became a mayor.

224
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So he had a very good life.

225
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
He wrote this book to his son

226
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
telling him life can be changed

227
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
and destiny can be changed.

228
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Because I read this book,

229
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
that's when I decided to change my ways.

230
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And it doesn't matter if I go blind or not,

231
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm going to be good and change my life.

232
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
That was 16 years ago.

233
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And now I'm still okay.

234
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I can still see.

235
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And life is perfect

236
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
as what I always wanted.

237
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So I know it really works.

238
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So this book is 500 years ago.

239
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
But it still applies to us today

240
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
because the universal truth is still the same.

241
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
This is the first chapter.

242
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So next time we're going to talk about

243
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
how do we reform to change our lives for the better

244
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
and change our destiny.

245
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
This is the class for today.

246
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Thank you for listening.
