1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,980
Today we are going to talk about

2
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,980
the Six Pyramidas.

3
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:38,980
The Six Pyramidas are a practice for Bodhisattvas to reach Buddhahood.

4
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,980
If we practice the Six Pyramidas,

5
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,980
more likely we'll be getting back to our true Buddha nature,

6
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,980
enlightened and become a Buddha.

7
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,980
It's all through cultivation.

8
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,980
How do we cultivate?

9
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:55,980
The most important thing is we have to be sincere.

10
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,980
Truly want to do it.

11
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,980
It's all in your heart.

12
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,980
It's not really how well you do it

13
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,980
or how much you give to others.

14
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,980
It's more how sincere you are into your practice.

15
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,980
It's all about sincerity.

16
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,980
Let's talk about the Six Pyramidas.

17
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,980
The first one is giving.

18
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,980
There are three kinds of giving.

19
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,980
The first is giving of wealth.

20
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,980
When poor people are in need,

21
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,980
we try to give them money or food,

22
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,980
whatever we can.

23
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,980
To help them out.

24
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,980
That is the kind of basic thing that we give to people

25
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,980
to make them have a better life.

26
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,980
The second kind of giving is giving of Dharma.

27
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,980
Nowadays not a lot of people have no food or no clothing.

28
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:49,980
Most people are just empty inside.

29
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,980
So when people are empty inside,

30
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,980
the only thing you can give them is Dharma.

31
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,980
Wisdom.

32
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,980
Help them become enlightened

33
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,980
and not be sad about their current situation

34
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,980
and be out of the sorrow that they're currently in.

35
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,980
We want to give people as Dharma or wisdom as we can.

36
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,980
The third giving is giving of fearlessness.

37
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,980
When someone is walking in the dark

38
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,980
or they're very depressed,

39
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,980
can we just be by their side and help them out?

40
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,980
When our friend is in need,

41
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,980
when they're really really in pain or they're sick,

42
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,980
we try to stay by their side and make them feel better.

43
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,980
A lot of times it's all about a sincere heart

44
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,980
into helping others.

45
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,980
That's what we call a bodhisattva

46
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,980
who's really on this earth to help other people.

47
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,980
And that's the purpose of our lives.

48
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,980
The second paramita, withholding precepts.

49
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,980
There are a lot of precepts that Buddha said for his disciples.

50
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,980
There are hundreds of them.

51
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,980
But they all fall into three categories.

52
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,980
What are the three categories?

53
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,980
The first is abandon evil.

54
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,980
Restrain ourselves from doing good.

55
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,980
Do evil deeds.

56
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,980
For example, stealing, lying, killing.

57
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,980
These are evil deeds that are not benefiting others.

58
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,980
We're trying to get rid of our evil deeds

59
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,980
and we cultivate all that is good.

60
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,980
Cultivate goodness.

61
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,980
So it's not enough just to get rid of our bad habits.

62
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,980
We need to go out of our way to do good things.

63
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,980
So that's cultivating goodness.

64
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,980
The last kind of precept is benefiting others.

65
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,980
So not only we get rid of our bad habits,

66
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,980
we do good deeds.

67
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,980
Our main concern is we want to benefit all other sentient beings.

68
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,980
So with your existence on this earth,

69
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,980
you're helping all other people.

70
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,980
So your life is very, very meaningful as a bodhisattva.

71
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,980
The third paramita is endurance.

72
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,980
There are three types of things that we need to endure.

73
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,980
The first is the biggest one.

74
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,980
That's people.

75
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,980
There are a lot of difficult people in our lives.

76
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,980
Everybody faces difficult people.

77
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,980
Sometimes they are rude to us.

78
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,980
Sometimes maybe they are rude to us physically or verbally.

79
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,980
Hurting us.

80
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:20,980
But can you remain loving and compassionate?

81
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,980
That's patience.

82
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,980
Can you still be kind

83
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,980
when someone is hurting you?

84
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,980
Or you want to fight back?

85
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:36,980
A bodhisattva will always remain calm and loving, compassionate.

86
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,980
That takes a great person to be able to do that.

87
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,980
Our greatness comes out when we're able to endure.

88
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,980
The second is enduring of environment.

89
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,980
That includes if it's too hot, too cold,

90
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,980
it's raining,

91
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,980
or even our legs are hurting

92
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,980
or still sitting there.

93
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,980
So that is still counting as the environment.

94
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,980
That's something we need to learn

95
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:05,980
to become better and enduring all kinds of difficult, harsh environment.

96
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:10,980
The third kind of endurance is enduring of the dharma.

97
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,980
Dharma can be very difficult to understand.

98
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,980
Sometimes it's really hard to listen to.

99
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,980
It's really hard for us to grasp what's the meaning of it.

100
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,980
For example, you talk about the Buddha nature.

101
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,980
What does it look like?

102
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:24,980
You don't understand.

103
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,980
So you got to endure it and keep listening to it.

104
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,980
One day you will become enlightened.

105
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,980
So you have to keep trying and be more patient.

106
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,980
And that's kind of endurance.

107
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,980
The fourth parameter is diligence.

108
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,980
We put in a lot of effort into doing the three above.

109
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:47,980
So this is pretty much the same as the holding the precepts.

110
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,980
The first kind of diligence is wearing our armor.

111
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,980
You know how our soldiers, they wear armor?

112
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,980
Wear armor to do what?

113
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,980
Fight against the enemy.

114
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,980
Who are the enemies?

115
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:07,980
Your own bad deeds.

116
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:13,980
So you're diligent in fighting the enemy of your own bad habits.

117
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,980
Anger, your ignorance, your greediness.

118
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,980
So we're putting on an armor of diligence

119
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,980
to fight our own problems.

120
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:23,980
Bad habits.

121
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:28,980
And we're diligent into cultivating all that is virtuous.

122
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,980
So pretty much it's the same as cultivating all the goodness.

123
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:36,980
We're diligent in benefiting all other people.

124
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,980
How can we be of service to others?

125
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,980
That's our purpose in life.

126
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,980
What's the meaning of life?

127
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:47,980
Meaning of life is we can be of benefit to others.

128
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:48,980
That's our main purpose.

129
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,980
How can we make this world a better place?

130
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,980
That's what we're on this earth.

131
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,980
How can we help others?

132
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,980
A bodhisattva, this is what he or she thinks of.

133
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,980
Diligent in these three ways.

134
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,980
The fifth parameter is the parameter of concentration

135
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,980
or deep concentration, samadhi.

136
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,980
That's what we're trying to do here when we meditate.

137
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:15,980
There are three kinds of deep concentration or samadhi.

138
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,980
The first kind is called mundane.

139
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,980
Mundane means worldly.

140
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:26,980
You don't have to be Buddhist to reach this kind of samadhi.

141
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,980
A lot of people, they don't need to learn Buddhism.

142
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,980
In their meditation, they can see the past, they can see the future,

143
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,980
they can fly, they can do anything.

144
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,980
A lot of people can reach that level.

145
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:41,980
But that is still called the mundane samadhi.

146
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,980
But as a Buddhist, we try to go here.

147
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,980
Transmundane samadhi.

148
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:50,980
This is when you know about the reincarnation.

149
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,980
It's very sad.

150
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:57,980
We need to get out of the six realms of reincarnation.

151
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:02,980
That's called the trans-worldly mundane meditation.

152
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,980
That's what we're trying to do.

153
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:10,980
The third type of concentration is called the supreme concentration.

154
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,980
What's the deepest kind of concentration?

155
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:17,980
When we're fully concentrated in our own Buddha nature.

156
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,980
When you're fully aware,

157
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,980
I am the universal power.

158
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,980
I am the source that created this universe.

159
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:29,980
With my thoughts, I can create anything.

160
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,980
That is the supreme enlightenment we all try to get to.

161
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:38,980
This is kind of in line with the three types of wisdom.

162
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,980
What are the three types of wisdom?

163
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,980
Wisdom of words.

164
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,980
If we don't have words,

165
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,980
how are we going to understand the Dharma?

166
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,980
The first type is a tool.

167
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,980
For us to learn the Dharma.

168
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,980
We call it the wisdom of words,

169
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,980
or literary wisdom.

170
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,980
Because we have words,

171
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,980
we're able to contemplate.

172
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,980
If I don't speak,

173
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,980
how can I guide you guys in the meditation?

174
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:08,980
You need words in order to develop contemplation wisdom.

175
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:14,980
Lastly, we want to reach the wisdom of true mark.

176
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:18,980
What's the truth about the universe?

177
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,980
We all have the Buddha nature.

178
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,980
That's the same as Buddha.

179
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,980
The most important thing that we need to realize,

180
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,980
that's the biggest wisdom on this earth.

181
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,980
When you realize you are one with the universe,

182
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:40,980
you are not this identity that you take on this lifetime.

183
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,980
You're like the big ocean,

184
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,980
not a little bubble in the ocean.

185
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,980
That's the ultimate wisdom.

186
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,980
Realize the supreme samadhi

187
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,980
is the same as the wisdom of true mark.

188
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,980
The six paramitas,

189
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,980
it gets rid of our defilements.

190
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,980
Giving gets rid of our greediness.

191
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,980
Precepts get rid of our what?

192
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,980
Bad karma.

193
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,980
Because we don't do bad deeds, right?

194
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,980
Endurance will get rid of our anger.

195
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:16,980
The more you endure,

196
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,980
the less angry you'll be.

197
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,980
The more diligent we are,

198
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,980
it gets rid of our laziness.

199
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,980
Laziness is a big problem.

200
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,980
We all become lazy

201
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,980
and will not succeed in your practice.

202
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,980
Concentration will overcome our scattered mind.

203
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,980
A scattered mind cannot succeed in anything they do

204
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,980
because they're always having wandering thoughts,

205
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,980
cannot focus.

206
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,980
So we need to train our mind

207
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,980
so it'll be still and concentrate.

208
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,980
Wisdom will get rid of our ignorance.

209
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,980
We are all ignorant thinking

210
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,980
that there is a self-identity.

211
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,980
There's an ego.

212
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,980
So we're trying to get rid of this ignorance

213
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,980
by learning a lot of wisdom.

214
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,980
So how do we learn wisdom?

215
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,980
By listening to dharma.

216
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,980
The more you learn about dharma,

217
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,980
the more you contemplate on the dharma,

218
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,980
the more wisdom you'll achieve.

219
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,980
So that's the sixth parameter

220
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,980
that a bodhisattva is always contemplating.

221
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:24,980
Sixteen years ago,

222
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,980
when this temple was first opened,

223
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,980
I was still working as an accountant.

224
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,980
One day, out of my one eye,

225
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,980
I couldn't see.

226
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,980
And it's like the lens is broken.

227
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,980
I went to the retina specialist.

228
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,980
He said,

229
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,980
you have a special retina disease.

230
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,980
Blood vessels in the macula,

231
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,980
is bleeding.

232
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:48,980
And I'm like,

233
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,980
what's the chance of it happening again?

234
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,980
And they said,

235
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,980
we don't know.

236
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,980
We don't know.

237
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,980
It's a rare disease.

238
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,980
So I kept working,

239
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,980
hoping it'll never happen again.

240
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,980
Six months later,

241
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,980
it happened to the other eye.

242
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,980
So from that day on,

243
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,980
my whole world is blurry.

244
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,980
Because I cannot see the world anymore

245
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,980
like a normal person.

246
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,980
I'm pretty much half blind.

247
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,980
That was sixteen years ago.

248
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,980
And I started learning about Buddhism.

249
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,980
I gave it all I got.

250
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,980
Because I really want to find out

251
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,980
how can I overcome this tragedy in my life.

252
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,980
I was only twenty-something.

253
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:30,980
I just got married.

254
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,980
Life was perfect.

255
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,980
And all of a sudden,

256
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,980
I'm in hell, you know.

257
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,980
I couldn't work.

258
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,980
I couldn't drive.

259
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:37,980
I couldn't see anything.

260
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,980
It's just the end of the world for me.

261
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,980
And I started learning Buddhism.

262
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:41,980
And I realized,

263
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,980
there is actually a way.

264
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,980
I actually have the Buddha nature.

265
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,980
I can still benefit the entire universe

266
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,980
if I wanted to.

267
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,980
So I started cultivating,

268
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,980
changing all my bad habits,

269
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:54,980
my selfishness,

270
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,980
and try to be as good as I can.

271
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,980
Now it's sixteen years later.

272
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,980
I am not blind.

273
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:02,980
It's like a miracle.

274
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,980
I haven't had any more bleeds.

275
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,980
I haven't been thinking about my eyes.

276
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,980
I just think about how do I benefit others.

277
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,980
Help everybody else get the benefit

278
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,980
out of Buddhism that I got.

279
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:14,980
After that,

280
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,980
I started doing everything I can.

281
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,980
And the world really changed for so much better.

282
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,980
I am so happy.

283
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,980
I want to give it back to the world,

284
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,980
what I got out of Buddhism.

285
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,980
Cultivating the six parameters

286
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,980
is what I like to do every day

287
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,980
because this is the way of life.

288
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,980
It's not really like a study.

289
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,980
It's a lifestyle that you just acquire.

290
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,980
And this is who you want to be.

291
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,980
Soon you will reach your true Buddha nature.

292
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,980
So that's it for today's class.

293
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,980
Thank you.
