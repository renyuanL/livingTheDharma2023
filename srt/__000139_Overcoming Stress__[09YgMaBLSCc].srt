1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,980
Today our class will be on

2
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,980
overcoming stress.

3
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,480
In this fast-paced world that we're living right now,

4
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,980
a lot of people are always stressed.

5
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,480
We can be stressed about work,

6
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,480
stressed about school,

7
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,980
stressed about just getting by every day,

8
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,480
trying to get by the daily actions.

9
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,480
If you're always stressed, you're not really living your life.

10
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,980
You're just living the way of life that is not necessary.

11
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:59,480
Stress is actually a self-induced emotion that is not necessary at all.

12
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,480
So today I'm going to share with you four tips

13
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,480
on how to overcome and get rid of all your stress.

14
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:11,480
The first is called understanding impermanence.

15
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,980
In Buddhism, we talk a lot about impermanence.

16
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,480
What's impermanence?

17
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,980
It means nothing is permanent.

18
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,980
You have to realize for a fact

19
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,480
that nothing in this world will last forever.

20
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,480
Everything is always changing.

21
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,480
Why?

22
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:34,480
Because everything has causes and conditions.

23
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,480
For example, I have a seed.

24
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,480
A seed.

25
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,480
I plant it on the ground.

26
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,480
I give it water.

27
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,480
I give it sunlight.

28
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,480
I give it fertilization.

29
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,480
Then it becomes a tree.

30
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,480
The main cause is what?

31
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,480
The seed, right?

32
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,480
And what are the conditions?

33
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,480
The water, the soil, the sunlight, right?

34
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,480
So if I put a seed here, would it ever grow?

35
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,480
No.

36
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,480
So everything rises because of causes and conditions.

37
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,480
Because everything has a lot of different factors involved,

38
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,480
nothing is really your control.

39
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,480
Everything in life can be caused and conditioned from your prior lifetimes.

40
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,480
That's caused by your present condition.

41
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,480
So go with the flow.

42
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,480
Go with whatever is happening in your life

43
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,480
and just accept it and go with the life as it is

44
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,480
without being stressed.

45
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,480
The first thing is to understand

46
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,480
everything is causes and conditions

47
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,480
and nothing will last forever.

48
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,480
Second is to let go of perfectionism.

49
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,480
When someone is always wanting to be perfect,

50
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,480
you always want everything to work out perfect,

51
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,480
everything to be done exactly as what you want it,

52
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,480
if that's the way it is,

53
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,480
then you're always stressed.

54
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,480
Because you always want things to be perfect.

55
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,480
That is just not the right way to live.

56
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,480
Everything is based on causes and conditions.

57
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,480
Are the causes and conditions always perfect?

58
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,480
No.

59
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,480
They're not perfect.

60
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,480
You will have failures,

61
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,480
you will have success.

62
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,480
And success and failure

63
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,480
because conditions are always changing.

64
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,480
So what you do is let go of the idea of being perfect

65
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,480
and just go with the flow.

66
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,480
As long as you do your best,

67
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,480
everything is already complete.

68
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,480
That is already perfect in itself.

69
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,480
You don't want to be attached to the final result.

70
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,480
Life, there's no certain result that's perfect.

71
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,480
What's our result?

72
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,480
What's our result?

73
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,480
What's at the end?

74
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,480
Death.

75
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,480
Death.

76
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,480
That's your result.

77
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,480
So there's no other result.

78
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,480
What you do is the process.

79
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,480
It's how you enjoy life.

80
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,480
If you're always stressed,

81
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,480
there's no enjoyment,

82
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,480
then what is this life of yours?

83
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,480
Everybody's outcome is the same.

84
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,480
But how you live your life can be different

85
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,480
if you choose not to be stressed.

86
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,480
So let go of the idea of being perfect

87
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,480
because that is not going to happen.

88
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,480
That's not going to happen

89
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,480
because everything is impermanent

90
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,480
and has causes and conditions.

91
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,480
So the third is detached from self-importance.

92
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,480
Of course,

93
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,480
you want to be responsible.

94
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,480
But a lot of times,

95
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,480
we think we're doing something that's so important.

96
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,480
We're the breadwinner of the household

97
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,480
or we're the leader,

98
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,480
we're the teacher,

99
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,480
you know,

100
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,480
we're the manager.

101
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,480
That's why we get stressed

102
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,480
because we feel so responsible.

103
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,480
That is actually not your true self.

104
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,480
That's actually the ego speaking.

105
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,480
That's the ego doing that.

106
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,480
You want to detach yourself

107
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,480
from the idea of how important you are.

108
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,480
Actually,

109
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,480
what you do on a daily basis,

110
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,480
are you really saving lives?

111
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,480
Not really, right?

112
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,480
But we think we're doing something so important,

113
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,480
but it's actually not.

114
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,480
You're just doing things.

115
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,480
If you take a test,

116
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,480
you're really stressed,

117
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,480
you think,

118
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,480
oh, this is so important.

119
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
This is a test of my life.

120
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,480
Will you do well?

121
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,480
No.

122
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,480
When you're very stressed,

123
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,480
your mind is always clouded.

124
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,480
You cannot think clearly.

125
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,480
You want to make sure

126
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,480
you are actually very calm

127
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,480
and not attached with any self-importance

128
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,480
or weigh the world upon you.

129
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,480
That way,

130
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,480
you actually do better on the test.

131
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,480
Do better at your work.

132
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,480
You actually will do better

133
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,480
with everything that you're doing

134
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,480
when you have no stress.

135
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,480
And lastly,

136
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,480
is have humor.

137
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,480
Don't be too serious.

138
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,480
Be able to laugh at things going wrong.

139
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,480
If you don't catch a flight,

140
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,480
okay,

141
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,480
that's the way it is.

142
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,480
It's not.

143
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,480
It's not the end of the world.

144
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,480
Be able to laugh at it

145
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,480
because why?

146
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,480
When we talk about impermanence,

147
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,480
we talk about the concept of emptiness

148
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,480
because everything is causes and conditions.

149
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,480
Life is like a dream.

150
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,480
It's actually empty.

151
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,480
If you know you're playing Monopoly,

152
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,480
the money is not real.

153
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,480
The property you buy,

154
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,480
not real.

155
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,480
Why would you be so stressed?

156
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,480
And Buddha says,

157
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,480
this life is just like Monopoly.

158
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,480
Okay, why would you be so stressed out?

159
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,480
You're just playing a game.

160
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,480
If you have that kind of mentality,

161
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,480
you will actually do things better,

162
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,480
be more creative.

163
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,480
You will think outside the box.

164
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,480
You will actually think of the big picture

165
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,480
and you will actually live a much better life

166
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,480
when you are detached from all these concepts

167
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,480
being so serious and so important.

168
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,480
So today is just to share with you

169
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,480
how you can reduce stress

170
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,480
on a more fundamental level.

171
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,480
And that will help you with your meditation

172
