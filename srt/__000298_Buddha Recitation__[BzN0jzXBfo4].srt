1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Today we are going to talk about Buddha recitation.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Recitation means being mindful, mindful of the Buddha day by day,

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
having Amitabha in our mind, be awakened and return to our original faith like Amitabha.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We will use verses from Zhongfeng Master's Thrice Yearning Chanting Service to talk about Buddha recitation.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Let's look at the first verse.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Buddha is in our mind.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
There are three kinds of mind.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
One is the mind or the heart in our body, the organ.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It is given to us by our parents through birth.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This is not our true mind.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The second mind is the mind that comprehends and reacts to different situations.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That is our deluded mind.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Our consciousness is full of the self and the ego, so it is also not our pure mind.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The third mind is the mind of truth that is eternal and constant.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This is our true mind.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
This mind does not gain anything when we reach Buddhahood,

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and it does not lose anything when we remain in the six realms of reincarnation.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It is the same for mortals and saints.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
By concentrating our mind when chanting,

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
the virtues and merits of Buddha will reflect upon us.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
For Buddha, he reached enlightenment through realization of this true mind.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
When we have this true mind,

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
we no longer create false imagery and attachments which causes suffering and pain.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
When we chant the name Amitabha,

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
it is to leave the deluded mind and return to our pure mind.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That is perfect dharma.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We are perfectly endowed with all the virtues and merits of the Buddha.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Recitation of Amitabha Buddha's name is how we realize our self nature.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
When our mind is annihilated,

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
our own intrinsic Buddha nature will appear.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
By then, there is no Buddha since we become one ourselves.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
When our mind is annihilated,

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
this is the deluded mind.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It creates false imagery.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
We become attached to them.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That's what's creating the samsara.

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
We should know that this life is like the images in the mirror.

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's only a false reflection.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The mirror itself should not be moved by the imagery.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Mortals and mundane don't understand.

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Just like we see in the TV screen there is soap opera.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We know the soap opera is fake,

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
but we don't know that our own life right now is also like a show that's in the TV screen.

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Buddha, on the other hand,

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
he realized that everything is illusory.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
He is not attached to appearances.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
He remains calm and unruffled.

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
We must realize that Buddha is all sentient beings

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
and all sentient beings are Buddha.

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Apart from our mind, there is no Buddha or beings.

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The only difference between Buddha and sentient beings is

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
one is awakened and one is confused.

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Buddha only sees the eternal.

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
In the temporary existence,

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,000
the human beings only sees the temporary existence in the eternal of life.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That's the difference.

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
When we chant Amitabha,

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
it becomes second nature.

59
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Then there is not the subject of the chanting mind

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
or the object of the name Amitabha.

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
There is not the attaining or the attainable.

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Both are unattainable and without permanent substance.

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
We let go of this attachment to even the Dharma.

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That's when we realize our self-nature.

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
With closest examination of ourselves,

66
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
once again, we will realize the difference.

67
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The only difference between Buddha and beings

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
is one is enlightened and one is confused.

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That's why Yongjia Master says,

70
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
In our dreams, we see the six realms of reincarnation.

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But when we are realized,

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
we can no longer see the six realms of reincarnation.

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
In the Saha world,

74
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
we probably heard of the story of Uddhara Master of the Tang Dynasty.

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Because of his virtues and cultivation,

76
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
he was honored as the national master.

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
He was given a throne made out of sandalwood

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
by the emperor at that time.

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Because of this,

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
he unknowingly gave rise to arrogance and vanity.

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Over time, a human face ulcer grew on his knee.

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The pain is unbearable.

83
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That's when he remembered,

84
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
when he was a novice,

85
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
there was an old monk.

86
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
His whole body was filled with foul-smelling ulcers.

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
No one dared to go near him.

88
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
But young Uddhara, out of great compassion,

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
took care of the old monk until he recovered.

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So the old monk told him,

91
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Young man, you will have great achievements this lifetime,

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
but you will also face great obstacles.

93
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
When you face trouble that you cannot overcome,

94
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
come see me in Jiu Long Mountain in Sichuan.

95
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
When you see the twin pine trees, you have arrived.

96
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Uddhara decided to go to the old monk and ask him for help.

97
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
When he arrived, it was already evening time.

98
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The attendant of the old monk already knew that he was coming.

99
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
He told him,

100
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
In the morning, we will wash away your ulcer with the spring water.

101
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So in the morning, the attendant took him to the spring water.

102
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Before he started washing,

103
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
the ulcer started speaking.

104
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
He said,

105
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Wait a minute.

106
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Many lifetimes ago, you were Yuan Ang.

107
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I was Cao Cuo.

108
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You wronged me.

109
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You framed me.

110
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So the emperor ordered to kill me.

111
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I suffered a horrific death,

112
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
and I swore to revenge.

113
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
But for ten lifetimes,

114
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
you were always a virtuous monk that holds precepts.

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So I could not get to you.

116
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
But now with your thought of vanity and arrogance,

117
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I was able to take revenge.

118
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Now with the spring water of the enlightened Kanaka,

119
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
our feud has ended.

120
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I will no longer take any revenge.

121
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
The bad blood has ended.

122
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Wu Da Master was in great shock.

123
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
He sprayed spring water on the ulcer.

124
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It was very painful.

125
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
He fainted.

126
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
When he woke up,

127
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
the ulcer was gone.

128
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The realized Wu Da Master took care of the old monk out of great compassion.

129
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And the monk that gave rise to vanity

130
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
and arrogance is also him.

131
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The only difference is in one thought,

132
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
awakened or confused.

133
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
In this stage,

134
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
our mind will illuminate as the different colored lotuses.

135
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
When we are awakened,

136
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
we will have the lotus flowers of four different colors

137
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
of red, white, blue, and yellow.

138
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Lotus flower symbolizes perfect purity.

139
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
The perfect purity and goodness

140
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
of our true mind.

141
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
We often say Chen Amitabha

142
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
until the flower flourishes

143
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
and Buddha comes into view.

144
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
This Buddha is not Amitabha.

145
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's the Buddha within yourself.

146
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
When we are perfectly pure without vexation,

147
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
then you will see the Buddha

148
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
that is your own true nature.

149
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Now let's look at the second verse

150
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
that has more description of this enlightened mind.

151
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The grand circular mirror of truth

152
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
like the true mind has no dust.

153
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
The grand circular mirror of truth

154
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
that's when our eighth consciousness

155
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
transforms into the great perfect mirror wisdom.

156
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The alaya consciousness is erased clean.

157
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
There's no more karmic seeds,

158
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
only perfect purity and wisdom.

159
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
That's why it says there's no more dust.

160
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The green lotus bud bears the birth of a Buddha.

161
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The lotus flower arrives

162
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
from our mind.

163
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
When we Chen Amitabha in this world right now,

164
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
there is a lotus bud growing

165
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
in the pond of the Western Pure Land.

166
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
The color, radiance, and size of the flower

167
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
all depend on our diligence.

168
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
If we're lazy, the flower will wither.

169
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
If we are very diligent,

170
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
have firm faith, resolve vows,

171
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
and enthusiastic practice,

172
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
then our flower will get bigger and brighter.

173
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's all depending on our mind.

174
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
We are diligent.

175
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
We need to protect this lotus

176
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
like we protect the infant in the mother's womb.

177
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
We do not want a miscarriage.

178
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
We should practice diligently

179
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
without giving rise to evil thoughts.

180
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Always have perfectly pure and kind heart.

181
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Look far away from the bottom of the pond

182
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
spread with golden sand.

183
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The bright lights from the seven jewels

184
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
shine from the jade pagoda.

185
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
This is talking about the living situation.

186
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
In the Western Pure Land,

187
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
which is symbolic of the beauty of our true nature,

188
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
the true mind.

189
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Over here on this earth,

190
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
the bottom of the pond is full of mud.

191
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But over there is full of golden sand.

192
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The buildings in our world

193
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
is made out of brick stones and concrete.

194
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Over there is made out of seven jewels,

195
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
precious stones that are soft,

196
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
fragrant, and illuminating.

197
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
All the wondrous,

198
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
the wondrous aspect of the Pure Land really exists.

199
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
They are all symbolic of our true nature.

200
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
That's why we say,

201
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Pure Mind,

202
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Pure Land.

203
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Or you can say,

204
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Enlightened Mind,

205
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Enlightened Land.

206
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's all up to our mind,

207
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
right here,

208
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
right now.

209
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
This lifetime,

210
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
we have the inconceivable,

211
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
rare opportunity to become a Buddha.

212
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
We should really let go of all the worries

213
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
and affliction.

214
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
See,

215
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
through the illusion of all appearances,

216
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
chant Amitabha single-mindedly.

217
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
True Buddha recitation means

218
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
mindful of our own Buddha nature,

219
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
our true mind.

220
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
That is true recitation.

221
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Always be aware that right here,

222
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
right now,

223
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
you are with your true mind

224
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
and there's nothing else that's more important

225
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
than be in the present moment

226
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
chanting Amitabha

227
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
and reciting in your true nature.

228
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So that's the class for today.

229
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Thank you for listening.

230
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Amitabha.
