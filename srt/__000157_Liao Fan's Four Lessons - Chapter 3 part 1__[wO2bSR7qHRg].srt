One of the 26

3
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:32,100
Today our class is still on Lao-Fan's Four Lessons.

4
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:41,100
This is a book from 500 years ago written by Lao-Fan on how to use your own potential to change your destiny.

5
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,780
So the first chapter was about his own life, how he changed himself.

6
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,640
Because he cultivated all that is good and changed all his bad ways.

7
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,340
He had two sons and he was a mayor and then he lived to an old age.

8
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,300
All because he changed his karma.

9
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,400
By karma we mean we do good deeds, we will have good results.

10
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,420
We do bad deeds, we will end up with bad results.

11
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:07,240
The second chapter was about reforming the bad ways.

12
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,820
So you have to change your bad ways and then do all that is good.

13
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,240
Today we are already on the third chapter.

14
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:18,100
So this third chapter is about ways to cultivate goodness.

15
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,100
After you change all the faults or the offenses that you have,

16
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,100
now we can really focus on doing all that is good.

17
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:33,100
A virtuous person creates a prosperous life, naturally, because you reap what you sow.

18
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,100
But you have to differentiate what is good and what is evil.

19
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,100
What is merit and what is offenses.

20
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,100
Sometimes it's kind of hard to tell.

21
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,100
You don't know if I'm doing it right or I'm doing it wrong.

22
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,100
There are eight pairs of differences.

23
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,100
There are eight pairs of differences.

24
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,100
You have to differentiate what's good or what's bad.

25
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,100
The first pair is real goodness and false goodness.

26
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,100
What do you buy, real goodness or false goodness?

27
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,100
There was a group of scholars.

28
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,100
They went to the Zhongfeng monk and asked him,

29
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,100
What is virtue? What is goodness?

30
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,100
And the monk said,

31
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,100
Why don't you guys tell me what is considered good?

32
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,100
All the scholars were like,

33
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:15,100
Oh, if you're respectful and you're nice, you're polite, that's being good.

34
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,100
If you yell at someone, mean to someone, that's considered bad.

35
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,100
And what did the monk say?

36
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,100
Unnecessary.

37
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,100
And they're like,

38
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,100
So what's the answer?

39
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,100
So what is real goodness?

40
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,100
And then the monk said,

41
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:35,100
If your intention is to benefit the other person, even if you yell at him, that's considered goodness.

42
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:40,100
So like the monk is teaching his kid by yelling or some punishment.

43
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,100
That is still what?

44
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,100
Virtue.

45
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,100
That's still goodness.

46
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,100
But if you're trying to flatter your boss and you're very polite, very nice,

47
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,100
that's still considered not good.

48
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,100
Because you're doing it for the selfish reasons.

49
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,100
We have to discern what's real and what's false.

50
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:01,100
Real is you're doing it for the benefit of others.

51
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:05,100
False is when you're doing it for your own benefit.

52
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,100
So that's the first pair.

53
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,100
Second pair is called honest and crooked.

54
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,100
This is kind of like the top one.

55
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,100
So honest means you're sincerely wanting to help others.

56
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,100
Some people, they do a lot of good deeds, but they want people to know.

57
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,100
They want to have a good name.

58
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,100
I'm a celebrity.

59
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,100
I want people to know that I am a good person as well.

60
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,100
So you try to flatter people.

61
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,100
That's not really considered goodness.

62
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,100
You want to do it because you really want to help others.

63
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,100
And you don't want any recognition.

64
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,100
You don't want anything in return.

65
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,100
If you want something in return and you're just trying to flatter others, that's not real.

66
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,100
You have to see it in your heart how good you truly are.

67
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:52,100
You really want to help someone just because you really care about the other person.

68
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,100
So that's the second pair.

69
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,100
The third pair is hidden goodness and visible goodness.

70
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,100
Hidden goodness is when nobody knows.

71
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,100
Sometimes we play with kids, playing games, Monopoly, whatever.

72
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,100
We let them win.

73
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:09,100
Or you lose to your friends because you want to make them happy, right?

74
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,100
You want your friend to feel better.

75
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,100
That's kind of hidden goodness.

76
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,100
So sometimes you do things without people knowing.

77
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,100
Or people accuse you of things.

78
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,100
Then you don't talk back.

79
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,100
And you don't try to explain yourself.

80
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,100
You just let it be.

81
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,100
That's called hidden goodness.

82
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,100
What's visible goodness?

83
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,100
Visible goodness is everybody knows you're doing well.

84
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,100
Everybody knows that you're virtuous.

85
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,100
When you enjoy the fame itself, that is already a good fortune to receive.

86
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,100
So it's best to do hidden goodness.

87
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,100
Nobody knows.

88
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,100
You don't want to tell anyone.

89
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,100
You go clean the bathroom.

90
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:44,100
You go do everything for other people without telling everybody that you're doing it.

91
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,100
That's the third pair.

92
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,100
Fourth pair is actual goodness and apparent goodness.

93
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,100
Sometimes it appears to be good, but actually it's not.

94
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,100
Because the longer effect might not be good for the whole society.

95
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,100
For example, Confucius had a student.

96
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,100
His name is Zhigong.

97
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:09,100
At that time, the country of Liu tried to save the people that's been putting in other countries as slavery.

98
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:13,100
If you pay for the ransom, you will get a reward from the government.

99
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,100
So Zhigong actually paid for a lot of people.

100
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,100
He paid for the ransom and saved them back.

101
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,100
But he didn't receive the government rewards.

102
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,100
He didn't want them.

103
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,100
Confucius heard about it.

104
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,100
What did he say?

105
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,100
He said, that's not real goodness.

106
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:34,100
Because you don't take the reward, then everybody will think, well, I'm being greedy if I take the reward.

107
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:39,100
If you do that, then nobody will go try to save other people because they will be hesitant.

108
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:44,100
Even if you're rich or you want to appear like you're very good, you shouldn't be doing that.

109
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,100
You should take the reward.

110
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:50,100
So everyone else will be gladly giving ransom to save our people.

111
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:58,100
We have to look at the longer effect, not just consider by yourself, but think about the long-term effect for the whole society.

112
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,100
There's another student of Confucius.

113
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,100
His name is Zilu.

114
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,100
One day, he saw a man drowning.

115
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,100
So he went and saved the man.

116
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,100
The man was very grateful, so gave him his cow.

117
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,100
Did Zilu take the cow?

118
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,100
Yes.

119
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,100
He took the cow.

120
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,100
What did Confucius say?

121
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,100
Good.

122
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,100
Good.

123
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:27,100
It's good you took the reward because nobody will hesitate to save other people's lives because you can get rewards.

124
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:34,100
So sometimes you think not taking stuff is good, but sometimes it's actually good to take the reward.

125
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:42,100
You have to really think of the long-term effect of whatever you're doing, not just about yourself, but about the society as a whole.

126
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,100
Okay.

127
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,100
So the fifth one is called proper and improper.

128
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,100
Sometimes we think we're doing good, but we're not.

129
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:55,100
For example, if you're overly polite, is that good?

130
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,100
No.

131
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:00,100
You know, you might make other people feel uncomfortable when you're doing too much.

132
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:04,100
Or the kid is very rude and you don't punish the kid.

133
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,100
You're going to make him worse, right?

134
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,100
So sometimes you have to judge, you know, if this is proper or improper.

135
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,100
There was a retired prime minister.

136
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,100
Of the Ming Dynasty.

137
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,100
He retired and went back to his village.

138
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:23,100
One night there was a drunk villager that came and insulted the prime minister.

139
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,100
The prime minister, he said to his servant, oh don't worry about it.

140
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,100
Just let him go because we don't want to be mean to him.

141
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:35,100
A year later, that same drunken person, he did a grave crime.

142
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,100
He was sentenced to death.

143
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,100
When the prime minister heard about it, he felt very sad.

144
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,100
He said,

145
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:48,100
if a year ago I actually punished him and made him know that he was wrong,

146
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:53,100
maybe he wouldn't do such a crime and now he's on death row.

147
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,100
He felt like he was responsible.

148
00:07:55,100 --> 00:08:00,100
Sometimes you think being kind is proper, but it's actually improper.

149
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:06,100
It takes a lot of wisdom and a lot of compassion to find out, to know for sure.

150
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:10,100
The sixth is called full and half.

151
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,100
What's full goodness?

152
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,100
And half goodness.

153
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:18,100
So my favorite story, there was a lady, she's very, very poor.

154
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,100
But she wants to donate to the temple.

155
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,100
All she has is two cents.

156
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:27,100
She brought the two cents and gave it to the abbot.

157
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,100
This is all I have, can you please take it?

158
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,100
The abbot was like, wow, you are so sincere.

159
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,100
This is all you have and you're actually giving it away.

160
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:40,100
So the abbot did a whole ceremony dedicating her marriage for her.

161
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,100
And she was so appreciative.

162
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,100
A year later, she became a concubine.

163
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,100
She became really rich.

164
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,100
She came back to the same temple and now she has lots of money

165
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,100
and she brought boxes of gold into the temple, gave it to the abbot.

166
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:59,100
The abbot looked at the money and told his little monk,

167
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,100
you can dedicate her marriage for her.

168
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,100
The concubine, she became very upset.

169
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:09,100
She said, no, a year ago I brought you two cents and you did the whole ceremony for me.

170
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:14,100
Now I brought all this gold and you tell the little monk to do it.

171
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,100
So the abbot said, before you were wholehearted and sincere.

172
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,100
Now you're very arrogant.

173
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,100
Your heart is not the same.

174
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,100
So your money is not worth the same.

175
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,100
So two cents is full goodness.

176
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:37,100
Hundreds of thousands of gold pieces is actually half goodness because of your heart.

177
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,100
You have to know for sure.

178
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,100
What's full and what's half.

179
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,100
And the seventh is called big and small.

180
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,100
What's big virtue or big goodness and small goodness.

181
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,100
Zhong Dawei, he's a government official.

182
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:55,100
One night he was brought to the underworld for judgment.

183
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:01,100
When he was there, the judge asked to bring the record of all his good deeds and bad deeds to the place.

184
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,100
The bad deeds, the record will fall to the whole Korea.

185
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,100
His good deed was only like a small little chopsticks.

186
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,100
The judge asked to weigh the good deed and the bad deed.

187
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:19,100
Surprisingly, the good deed, the chopsticks side, actually weighs more than the full Korea of bad deeds.

188
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:23,100
And he asked the judge, oh, I'm not even 40 years old.

189
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,100
How come I have all these bad deeds?

190
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:30,100
And the judge said, every one of your thoughts is a deed.

191
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,100
Even if you didn't do it, it's already recorded.

192
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,100
That's why it's full in the whole Korea.

193
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,100
Then he said,

194
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,100
What is the one little good deed that I did?

195
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:44,100
He said, oh, once the emperor wants to build a bridge.

196
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,100
But it requires thousands of people's hard work.

197
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,100
And you actually wrote something to oppose it.

198
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,100
That was a very good deed.

199
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,100
Because, you know, you're really sincere at the time.

200
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,100
You try to do for the benefit of the whole countrymen.

201
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,100
So what was big, what was small.

202
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,100
Depending on how big your heart is.

203
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,100
He was really sincere in trying to help all the people.

204
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,100
So that one good deed actually was very big.

205
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,100
The last one is called difficult and easy.

206
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,100
There are some things that are difficult for us to give.

207
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,100
For example, some people, they really like money.

208
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,100
So give away money is really hard.

209
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,100
There was a Mr. Chen.

210
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:31,100
He saw a poor man that was about to go to jail for something that he didn't do.

211
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,100
He wants to help the poor man.

212
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:41,100
So he actually gave up ten years of his salary to save the poor person from going to jail.

213
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,100
So he doesn't have to be separated from his family.

214
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,100
He's giving up things that's very difficult to give up.

215
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,100
If you want to change your ways, you want to give what's most difficult for you.

216
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:57,100
If you're really greedy for fame or fortune, then you should give those up.

217
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:03,100
All these you can tell is not just by the appearance of what's good or what's bad.

218
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,100
It's all on how big your heart is

219
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:11,100
and how sincerely you want to help all sentient beings to live a happier life.

220
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,100
Today we talked about the eight kinds of good deeds.

221
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:20,100
And next time, we're going to talk about the second part of cultivating goodness.

222
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,100
So that's the class for today.

223
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,100
Thank you.

224
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,100
Thank you.
