1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,680
Today we are going to discuss Aspirations for Enlightenment.

2
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,560
This is from The Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana by Aswagosha Bodhisattva.

3
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,760
There are three parts to this.

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,820
One is Aspiration for Enlightenment through the Perfection of Faith.

5
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,060
Two is Aspiration for Enlightenment through Understanding and Deeds.

6
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,440
Three is Aspiration for Enlightenment through Insight.

7
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:44,220
All Bodhisattva, they aspire to the Enlightenment realized by all Buddhas, disciplining themselves

8
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,000
to this end and advancing toward it.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,520
Now let's look at Aspiration for Enlightenment through the Perfection of Faith.

10
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,180
We must have faith in our true nature.

11
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,740
We call it Suchness.

12
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,960
We need to cultivate three kinds of mind.

13
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,700
One is the mind of straightforwardness.

14
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:07,980
To correctly meditate on the principle of Suchness, Suchness is also called Emptiness.

15
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,240
It is the essential nature of reality.

16
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:17,340
It is only through delusion that all things come to be differentiated.

17
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:23,860
If one is to be free from delusion, then there will be no appearances of objects regarded

18
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:24,860
as absolutely independent.

19
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:33,000
Then we know what's Emptiness, that's Suchness, so correctly contemplate on it.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,460
Two is the mind of Profoundness.

21
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,520
There is no limit to the joyful accumulation of all kinds of goodness.

22
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,880
In our nature, we are perfectly endowed with all the excellent qualities.

23
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,080
Number three is the mind of Great Compassion.

24
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,600
We naturally have great compassion.

25
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,080
We wish to uproot the suffering of all sentient beings.

26
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,080
So this is the mind of Great Compassion.

27
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,080
We naturally have great compassion.

28
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,180
We wish to uproot the suffering of all sentient beings.

29
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,860
So this is the mind of Great Compassion.

30
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,860
We naturally have great compassion.

31
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,860
We naturally have great compassion.

32
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,860
We naturally have great compassion.

33
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,860
We naturally have great compassion.

34
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,860
We naturally have great compassion.

35
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:01,860
So this is our Bodhi mind, who we really are.

36
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,340
Like a precious gem that is pure and bright, but is now marked in impurities.

37
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,660
Now we need to polish them with expedient means.

38
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:13,580
Therefore expedient means, to have the mind of straightforwardness, we have the fundamental

39
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,580
means.

40
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,060
This is the basis.

41
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:23,660
We need to meditate on the fact that the essential nature of all things is unborn, is emptiness.

42
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,660
So we can divorce it.

43
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:31,280
ourselves from deluded view and we do not abide in the samsara. On the other hand, we

44
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:38,120
do not abide in the nirvana. We know everything is cause and effect and it doesn't get lost

45
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:45,100
so we need to cultivate our great compassion, practice meritorious deeds and to transform

46
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:53,720
all sentient beings equally. Bodhisattva do not abide in samsara and do not abide in nirvana.

47
00:02:53,720 --> 00:03:00,120
They actually abide in the suchness which is emptiness. To have the mind of profoundness,

48
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:06,100
we have two means. Means of stopping evil and means of increasing goodness. Means of

49
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:12,840
stopping evil means develop the sense of shame and repentance. That's how we stop our evil

50
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:19,480
and prevent them from growing. One is to conform to the faultlessness of the essential nature

51
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,700
of reality. Then we have the means of increasing the

52
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:30,800
capacity of our goodness by diligently honor and pay homage to the triple jewels of Buddha,

53
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:37,460
Dharma, Sangha and praise, rejoice and beseech the Buddha. That's how we increase our goodness.

54
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:43,460
Then to have the mind of great compassion, we have the means of the great vow of universal

55
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:50,140
salvation. To liberate all sentient beings down to the last one, no matter how long it

56
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,380
might take to help them to attain perfect nirvana.

57
00:03:53,700 --> 00:04:00,540
We really have this bodhi mind. We just need to really believe in it and know our true

58
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:06,200
nature. There's an old man with Alzheimer's disease. Every day at the same time, he would

59
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,820
go sit in the front porch. All the kids would get off the school bus. Kids would come meet

60
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:17,140
him and he would think he's meeting them for the first time. All the kids, they patiently

61
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:21,800
talk to the old man as if they're meeting him for the first time. So all these amazing

62
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,800
kids, they are like Buddha. They are like Buddha. They are like Buddha. They are like Buddha.

63
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,680
They are like Buddha. They are like Buddha. They are like Buddha. They are like Buddha.

64
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,700
They are like Buddha. They are like Buddha. They are like Buddha. They are like Buddha.

65
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:30,620
We all have the Buddha nature. So believe in our humanity, in who we really are. Now

66
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:37,320
we have strong faith, then we can take action by understanding and these by practicing the

67
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:44,460
six parameters. In the essential nature of reality, we are free from covetousness. Therefore,

68
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:52,020
we devote ourselves to giving. The first parameter, we want to give to the needy in terms of our

69
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:52,800
money, in terms of the dharma.

70
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:59,300
of the Dharma and in terms of fearlessness. Anyone who's in hardship or fearful, we want

71
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:04,400
to help them. No matter what you do, even when you're cooking, have the heart of giving.

72
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:10,240
People who eat your food will feel your love and kindness. So always have the heart of

73
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,520
giving because we naturally don't have any greed or stinginess in our nature. Number

74
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:22,800
two is to know that in our true nature, we are free from defilement. Therefore, we devote

75
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,880
ourselves to precepts, holding precepts, stopping evil and increasing goodness. That's who

76
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:35,780
we're supposed to be. So getting rid of our jealousy, deceit, flattery, and hatred is

77
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:42,060
totally possible because we don't have them in the first place. Number three is to know

78
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,500
that in the essential nature of reality, we are free from anger.

79
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:52,820
Therefore, we devote ourselves to endurance. We naturally have endurance in all kinds of

80
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:59,760
situations. When there is gain or loss, honor or dishonor, praise or blame, suffering or

81
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:06,460
joy, we naturally will stay calm and peaceful and patient. Number four, we are free from

82
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:12,060
indolence. Therefore, we devote ourselves to diligence. Do not be sluggish in doing

83
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,500
goodness. Purge ourselves of cowardice. Be courageous and selfless.

84
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,420
Do not be overjoyed, counselors. We want to pay homage to the Buddha. Have a sincere heart

85
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:27,900
of repentance and we see the Buddha for guidance and rejoice for other people's happiness.

86
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:34,060
That way we will avoid various hindrances and our capacity for goodness increases.

87
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:39,720
Number five is to know that in the commission we are free from scattered minds. Therefore,

88
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:46,360
we devote ourselves to concentration. Concentration means meditation, or we call it cessation.

89
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,760
We want to stop all wandering thoughts.

90
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,640
It's not that we first meditate on the object of senses in the external world

91
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,640
and then negate them in our mind.

92
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:00,600
It is only when our mind wanders off, then we bring it back to the correct thought.

93
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,120
What is the correct thought?

94
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,160
It's to know everything is mind only.

95
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,440
It's emptiness.

96
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,280
There is no external world of object as conceived.

97
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,760
Even this mind is devoid of any real mark of its own,

98
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,880
which would indicate its substantiality.

99
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:23,240
Therefore, it is not substantially conceivable as such at any moment.

100
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,920
That is the reality.

101
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,800
That's how we transcend all thoughts.

102
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:33,240
Number five is to know that in the essential nature of reality,

103
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,320
we are free from ignorance.

104
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,200
Therefore, we devote ourselves to wisdom.

105
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,440
This wisdom is also called clear observation.

106
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,280
We want to observe that

107
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:44,600
all

108
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:52,440
conditioned phenomena are stationary and are subject to instantaneous transformation

109
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,800
and destruction.

110
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:59,560
All activities of the mind arise and extinguish from moment to moment.

111
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,720
So there's no fixed substance.

112
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,840
There's only creation of condition.

113
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,960
So the past is like hazy as a dream,

114
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,000
and the present is like a flash of lightning,

115
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,120
and the future is like the cloud that

116
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,560
rises up suddenly.

117
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,600
So everything is impermanent and empty.

118
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,280
And when we understand this,

119
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,080
we feel great pity for all sentient beings that's going through suffering.

120
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,960
We are suffering all kinds of misery of the body and mind.

121
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,800
And at the present moment,

122
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:37,720
we are going through incalculable pressures and constraints that's difficult to forsake,

123
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,560
difficult to shake off.

124
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,640
That's why we want to make great vows to be free from all discrimination.

125
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:51,960
And we want to be able to practice all meritorious deeds and to apply limitless expedient means

126
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:57,960
so to help all suffering sentient beings to attain the perfect nirvana.

127
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,760
This is how we have real wisdom.

128
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,600
By having faith and understanding in the suchness,

129
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,520
then performing the six paramitas is easy.

130
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,680
Three is the result.

131
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,160
Aspiration for enlightenment through insight.

132
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,320
Through insight, we have three kinds of subtle modes of mind.

133
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,240
One is the true mind,

134
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,720
when we are free from all intellectual discriminations.

135
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,720
Again, the true mind is free from discrimination,

136
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,320
free from thoughts.

137
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,960
That's when we are self-enlightened.

138
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:38,200
Then we have the mind capable of applying expedient means to enlighten others.

139
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,880
Now we can spontaneously help all sentient beings

140
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,080
because now we are capable.

141
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:50,920
Number three is the mind subject to the influence of karma operating in subconsciousness.

142
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:56,440
We are still subject to karma when we still have any little bit of thinking

143
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,520
in terms of helping sentient beings.

144
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,720
So there's still movement in the subconsciousness.

145
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,360
Until we reach perfect enlightenment,

146
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,320
we will still have this subconsciousness.

147
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,880
So this is how we become enlightened through our aspiration.

148
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:17,400
Abbas Gosha, Bodhisattva, said the main reason I wrote this treatise

149
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,480
is to cause all men to free themselves from all sufferings

150
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,920
and to gain final bliss of enlightenment.

151
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:31,400
He just wants to help all of us to awaken so we don't have to suffer anymore.

152
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:37,240
Lastly, I want to share with you his prayer in the beginning of the treatise.

153
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,120
He said,

154
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,720
May all sentient beings be made to discard,

155
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,760
their doubts,

156
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,920
to cast aside all their evil attachments,

157
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:52,120
and to give rise to the correct faith in the Mahayana

158
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,520
that the lineage of the Buddha may not be broken off.

159
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,800
He just wants us to have no more doubts,

160
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,520
have real faith in the suchness in the Mahayana.

161
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:09,080
That's how the lineage of Buddhahood can be carried on.

162
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,000
So we all have the mission

163
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,720
to carry

164
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,600
on this lineage of Buddhahood,

165
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,800
just by knowing that we have the Buddha nature,

166
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,920
the suchness,

167
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,280
that is emptiness,

168
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,960
that's who we really are.

169
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,560
So that's the class for today.

170
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,680
Thank you for listening.

171
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,640
Amitabha.
