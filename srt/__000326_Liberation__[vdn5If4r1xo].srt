00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Today's topic is Liberation.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Buddhism is education that teaches how to be free from the cycle of reincarnation, life and death, and to reach Buddhahood.

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's look at this verse.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
All Buddhas gain liberation from cultivation of the mind.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We do not obtain liberation from worshipping Buddha or Bodhisattva or reading a whole bunch of sutras.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We gain liberation from cultivating our own mind.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Patriarch Bodhidharma says invoking Buddha's name results in good karma.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Reciting sutras results in good memory.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Keeping precepts results in good rebirth.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And making offerings results in future blessing.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But no Buddha.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You can do all these good deeds, you will have the corresponding good karma.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But you will not have a Buddha.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That means you will not reach Buddhahood.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:25,000
If you do not find your true nature doing these good deeds, your intention is wanting this good karma, good retribution, you will not reach Buddhahood.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Because you are not with your enlightened mind.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The key of liberation is to see your own nature, to see who you really are.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The mind is originally pure, clear and undefiled.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Our true mind is always pure and undefiled and clear.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Knowing this fact, every day we should be free from our greed, anger and ignorance.

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
All these can be eradicated.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Therefore a cultivator will always be aware of his thoughts.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
When he or she has greed, anger or ignorance, catch it right away.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
This is called turning the light inward and illuminate the mind.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Do not be attached to the situation that's making you upset or making you happy or making you greedy.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's not the situation.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Turn the light inward and look at yourself.

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Admit that this is affliction.

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
When you know it's affliction, then you will not have affliction anymore.

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
When you know being angry is not good, you will stop being angry.

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So a cultivator can always change thoughts and break the old negative pattern of thinking.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Return to who we are originally.

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
This is pure, clear and undefiled.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:01,000
In the Shakyamuni Sutra, there is a Bodhisattva maintaining the ground.

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
He loves to pave the road and he loves to build bridges, but he doesn't know why he's doing it.

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Until one day he met a Buddha.

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The Buddha told him, you should level your mind ground, then everything else in the world will be leveled.

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
He became enlightened.

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
He realized leveling, paving the road is not helping the world.

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's only when our mind is leveled without judgment and discrimination and defilement, it's at peace, then the world will be at peace.

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So now we are all very concerned about the politics, about the corruption and the chaos of the world.

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But we do not know that it's all from our own mind.

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So see the world and realize the mind.

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Take the blame and bear the responsibility of our collective karma.

45
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
This is not because of others doing.

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's because of our own mind.

47
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,000
If we can level our own mind, our mind is at peace, then the world will be at peace.

48
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So world peace is not other people's responsibility.

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's your own responsibility.

50
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Every day by changing your thoughts for the better, then you are changing the world for the better.

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You want world peace, then your mind should be at peace.

52
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So that's how we cultivate.

53
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
By cultivating the mind, then we will be liberated.

54
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The mind, it might reincarnate in the five realms of existence, but it remains fresh and unpolluted by any form.

55
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
In reality, we still have reincarnation.

56
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We have reincarnation in the five realms.

57
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
We usually say the six realms of reincarnation.

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Hell, hungry, ghost, animal, asura realm, human, and heavenly beings.

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It says five here because the asura realm doesn't have its own world.

60
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's gathered in the other realms.

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Why do we keep going through lifetime and lifetime of reincarnation?

62
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
In the Shravagama Sutra, it says killing, stealing, and lust.

63
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
These are the basic roots of reincarnation.

64
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Because we have killing, stealing, and lust.

65
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
These are the conditions and we have the causes of greed, anger, and ignorance.

66
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
That's why we are reincarnating.

67
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
From these causes and conditions comes the continuity of karmic retribution.

68
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,000
We pass through hundreds and thousands of eons in a sustained mutual entanglement because of these.

69
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
When the three conditions of reincarnation come together,

70
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
the three conditions of the karma of killing, stealing, and lust are cut off,

71
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
the three causes for them do not arise.

72
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
When the madness ceases, just that ceasing is bodhi.

73
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,000
If we can stop the madness, stop the deluded mind, that is our bodhi mind.

74
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That is our true mind.

75
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
All we have to do is to stop the madness of greed, anger, and ignorance,

76
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
and stop the conditions of killing, stealing, and lust.

77
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,000
When we talk about Pure Land Buddhism, it's not apart from this karmic retribution.

78
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,000
We should know when our mind is pure, we are having the causes of going to the Pure Land.

79
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Every day we must cultivate our mind as a Pure Land practitioner

80
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
to get rid of our greed, anger, and ignorance.

81
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
If we have the same mind as Amitabha, then we will definitely go to his Pure Land.

82
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So do not think that you just recite Amitabha's name and you don't have to cultivate much.

83
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
That is not true.

84
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You must watch your mind constantly and to know your defilements,

85
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:06,000
and to know you need to change your thoughts for the better to be aligned with your pure mind.

86
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Lastly, for those who comprehend this,

87
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
they will indeed achieve the Great Path.

88
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
If we can just understand what is the cause of reincarnation

89
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and how do we return to our pure mind,

90
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
we will reach the Great Path.

91
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
That's Buddhahood.

92
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
In the Shakyamuni Sutra, it says,

93
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
when the cause and conditions of the madness ceases,

94
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
then the nature that is not mad will naturally come forth.

95
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
We do not look for Buddha mind anywhere.

96
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
All we have to do is stop the madness, stop the deluded mind,

97
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
and naturally the pure mind will come forth.

98
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So this is the same as what we have said.

99
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
To know illusion is to depart from it.

100
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
To depart from illusion is to be enlightened.

101
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So all we have to do is to know.

102
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Then we will naturally go back to our true mind.

103
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
That is the Great Path.

104
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Furthermore, I would like to share Bodhisattva Nagarjuna's famous quote.

105
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
For dharmas arising from conditions,

106
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I affirm that they are empty.

107
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
They are conventional but yet indicate the meaning of the middle way.

108
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Our mind, it is empty in nature,

109
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
but it has conventional existence.

110
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
When you balance the emptiness and the conventional existence,

111
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
that is the middle way.

112
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I combine it with the top verse.

113
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I affirm that they are empty.

114
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It is talking about the middle way.

115
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
The mind that is originally pure, clear, and undefiled.

116
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Emptiness, we usually use pure to symbolize.

117
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
We are originally empty,

118
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
which means our greed, anger, and ignorance,

119
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
they do not have any nature.

120
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So we can definitely eradicate and conquer our afflictions.

121
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Keep turning the light inward to illuminate the mind

122
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
and change the thought and change the pattern.

123
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Know that they also have the conventional existence

124
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
that's talking about the reincarnation.

125
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
We are really reincarnating in the five realms.

126
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
But use this conventional phenomenon to cultivate the real mind.

127
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Recently, I volunteered for an organization for the visually impaired.

128
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I met a lot of great people who are visually impaired.

129
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Most of them are completely blind.

130
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I serve them, give them food, and talk to them.

131
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
All the worries and problems in my own life just seem to disappear.

132
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
All I'm concerned about is how to serve them and make them happy

133
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
because they really need help.

134
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,000
That was when I realized our mind is naturally kind and compassionate and pure.

135
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
When you can bring out your pure mind,

136
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
all your defilements just seem to go away.

137
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So we need to bring ourselves back to this perfect, kind, pure, and loving heart.

138
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Every life situation is to help us realize our own mind.

139
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Stop being attached to the world, to all the phenomena,

140
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:32,000
but return to our true nature and change our afflictions and defilements.

141
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Then every day is very meaningful because we are really improving.

142
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
We are really turning into a saint.

143
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Lastly, we will understand the middle way,

144
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
which is the great path, which is Buddhahood.

145
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Our Buddha mind is the middle way.

146
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
This is how we are originally,

147
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
and we will definitely go back to the middle way

148
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
if we can just watch our thoughts

149
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
and always be aware of our mind.

150
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
That's the class for today.

151
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Thank you for listening. Amitabha.
