1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Today we are going to talk about Suffering as Our Teacher Part 2.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Where is our temple?

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Our temple is not a physical structure.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It is actually in our daily lives.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This is called cultivating meditation through external conditions.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Today we will talk about the 5 other kinds of sufferings and learn how to use them as our spiritual teacher.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Number 6. When interacting with others, do not seek self-benefits.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
There will be some friends and family members who are not always good to you.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
They might take advantage of you, betray you, or mistreat you.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
If we understand karma, we will know that we actually done this to them in our prior lifetimes.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So gladly pay them back and confess for our sins.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And also we must think that we are now a bodhisattva.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We should not think about our own self-interest but only be concerned with serving others.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
In the Ming Dynasty, there was a Mr. Wu Zetian.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
When he was young, his mother passed away.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
His father remarried to a stepmother.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The stepmother mistreated him and only liked his younger stepbrother who loved to gamble.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
When he got older, he married a very virtuous wife.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
But the stepmother also mistreated her.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
His father passed away and left a lot of land and inheritance.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,000
His stepmother gave everything to the younger brother, only gave him a little shack and an infertile land.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
But he did not give up.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
He worked very hard for a decade and became a very wealthy man.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:02,000
At the same time, his stepmother and stepbrother squandered away all their inheritance and became homeless.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Mr. Wu and his wife, without any hesitation, took in the stepmom and stepbrother and helped the stepbrother quit the gambling addiction.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The whole family now lives happily together.

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Mr. Wu used kindness to pay back ungratefulness.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's what we mean by use ungrateful friends as resources to build our loving kindness.

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Number seven, do not expect others to be always respectful and cooperative.

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
People are impermanent.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
They might one day like you and the other day dislike you.

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
They will be people who are against you, criticize you, and disrespect you.

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
But we should use the opposition as support.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
To build our patience.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Master Hua of the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas, in the summer of 1987, he was having an inter-religious conference.

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
On the first day, there was a group of New Age Christians that were demonstrating outside the temple.

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Mr. Hua said, oh great, please invite them in.

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
His disciples didn't do anything, so he actually went down there to greet them himself.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
He brought them in and said, please send them in.

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
He said, if you want to go to the front row, you can present first to what you have to say.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
If you guys want food, beverage, or anything you need, we will provide them for you while you're demonstrating here.

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
If you want to scold me, you want to hit me, even if you want to kill me, I will not fight back at all.

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Just do whatever you like.

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Why? Because I have the spirit of Jesus.

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
They were all dumbfounded and intrigued.

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The next day, they came back very respectfully.

47
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
They joined the conference, and they all became friends.

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So use opposition as support to train our patience.

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Number eight, do not expect rewards when helping others.

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Some people donate because they want to be famous, or for tax write-off, or just for a sense of fulfillment.

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But all these are impure intentions.

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Buddha taught us to practice threefold wheel of life.

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Threefold wheel of essential emptiness.

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
With the threefolds are the giver, the receiver, and the gift.

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
We should not be attached to any of these three things when we are giving.

56
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
We want to be away from all forms that is true giving.

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Just like those teachers and doctors who volunteer to go to the rural villages of third world countries for most of their careers,

58
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
with minimal pay and no recognition.

59
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Just do it because they care.

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
That is true altruism.

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
That is true giving.

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So use giving as abandonment.

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's like a pair of worn out shoes.

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You just throw it away.

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You don't really care about how much you helped others.

66
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You should forget about it.

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So use giving as abandonment.

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Number nine, beware of beneficial temptations.

69
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
This is called holding precepts.

70
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
We do not want to be greedy for things we're not supposed to have.

71
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
We don't want to corrupt our moral values because of personal gains.

72
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
There was a virtuous person in the Song Dynasty.

73
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
His name is Fan Zhongyan.

74
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
When he was young, he was poor, so he had to study in the back of a temple for three years.

75
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
All he ate was porridge and some vegetables.

76
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
One day, there was two rats that came in and stepped all over his porridge.

77
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
One is a white rat, one is a yellow rat.

78
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So he chased them outside and they all scurried into a wattle tree.

79
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
He went to the wattle tree.

80
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
He saw two rat holes.

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
One rat hole is shimmering with golden light and one is shimmering with white light.

82
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So he dug open the hole.

83
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Sure enough, he found a pot of gold and a pot of silver.

84
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But he was not moved by the precious metal.

85
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
He covered them up and pretended it never happened.

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Thirty years later, there was a great fire that devastated the temple.

87
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So the monk wrote to Fan Zhongyan asking him for help.

88
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
By now, he's already a prime minister.

89
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Fan Zhongyan did not offer any help.

90
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
He only wrote back a letter.

91
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
He says,

92
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
West side of the wattle tree, there is a pot of gold.

93
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
East side of the wattle tree, there is a pot of silver.

94
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Use half of it to rebuild the temple.

95
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Half of it for all the monks.

96
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Mr. Fan Zhongyan,

97
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,000
he was not greedy for money because he wanted to hold on to his moral values.

98
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
That's most important to him.

99
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So we want to resist temptation as wealth.

100
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Our biggest wealth is when we don't have any greed.

101
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
We're content with what we have and we hold on to our ethics.

102
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Number ten,

103
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
do not be troubled by false accusations.

104
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Of course,

105
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
if it's about the well-being of the people of your country,

106
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
or the world,

107
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
you have to speak up.

108
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
But if it's about yourself,

109
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:26,000
you can choose to use the injustice as practice for our concentration and wisdom.

110
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
In the early 1900s,

111
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
there was a famous monk in Taiwan, Master Guangqing.

112
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Master Guangqing cultivated up in the mountains most of his life.

113
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
When he come back down to the temple,

114
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
he basically just stayed in the main hall and meditated all day and all night.

115
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
One day,

116
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
the money in the donation box was taken.

117
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Everybody thought Master Guangqing stole the money.

118
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So they treated him like a thief and treated him with disdain.

119
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Weeks later,

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,000
a monk from the temple announced that they purposely hid the money to test the master's cultivation.

121
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Now everybody is praising the master for his great cultivation.

122
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But the master,

123
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
he was not moved.

124
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
When they call him a thief,

125
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
he was not moved.

126
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
He went on with his meditation.

127
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
When now they call him a great master,

128
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
he is still not moved.

129
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
He went on with his routine meditation.

130
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So this is called the real concentration and wisdom.

131
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
That's the real samadhi.

132
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So all these life situations,

133
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
they are to train us to become a bodhisattva.

134
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Basically the six parameters.

135
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Number six and seven,

136
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
it is about the patient's parameter.

137
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Number eight is the giving parameter.

138
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Number nine is precept parameter.

139
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Number 10 is the concentration and wisdom parameter.

140
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And all of them need the diligence parameter

141
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
because we want to be mindful of the situation.

142
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So gold must be refined by melting.

143
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
The cherry blossom must go through the winter of harsh cold.

144
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Men must go through trials and tribulations to be successful.

145
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
All these life situations,

146
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
which we know they are impermanent and unreal,

147
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
but we take the opportunity to use them

148
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
to train us to grow into a bodhisattva

149
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
and soon we will reach Buddhahood.

150
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So that's the class for today.

151
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Thank you for listening.

152
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Amitabha.
