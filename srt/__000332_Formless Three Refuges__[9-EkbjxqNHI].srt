1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,280
Today we are going to talk about the Formless Three Refuges.

2
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,720
We take refuge in the Buddha, Dharma and the Sangha.

3
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,360
That is how one becomes a Buddhist.

4
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,600
Take means to turn back.

5
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,640
Refuge means to rely on.

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,140
The Triple Jewels as our guidance in our lives.

7
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:40,100
We will discuss the Formless Three Refuges together with the Three Bodies of Buddha,

8
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,800
the Trikayas in Master Huinan's Platform Sutra.

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,640
When we think of the Buddha, we might think of Shakyamuni Buddha who is our teacher.

10
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,940
When we talk about the Dharma, we might think of his teaching, his sutras and the Sangha.

11
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,620
We think of the monastic community.

12
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,360
But this is the Triple Jewels in its form.

13
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,960
When we talk about the Formless Triple Jewels, we are talking about the Buddha, the Dharma

14
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,800
and the Sangha within ourselves.

15
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:17,620
There is no other place to retreat to because there is no Triple Jewels outside of us.

16
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:22,380
Buddha means the enlightenment nature in our own mind.

17
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:28,820
We rely on this awakened nature so the evil and the lucid notion do not arise.

18
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,360
The Dharma increases, the content is unknown.

19
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,340
Lust and greed do not bind us.

20
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,220
That's the culmination of our merit and wisdom.

21
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:44,060
When we rely on this awakened nature, we are at the peak of our virtues.

22
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,340
We will not have delusive cravings and bad thoughts.

23
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,260
Then we rely on the Dharma which is the orthodoxy, the right views.

24
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:58,000
We are free from wrong views such as egotism, arrogance and craving.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
When we are free from wrong views, we are free from negative views, such as selfishness,

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,400
arrogance and craving.

27
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:07,860
this is the best way to get rid of our desires our desires are insatiable we might be greedy

28
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:18,260
for food money or fame or lust all these desires rob us of our serenity we want to use the dharma

29
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:26,980
to get rid of our desires we also want to rely on the sangha which is our own purity we have

30
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:33,860
innate purity within us no matter what circumstances we're not contaminated by

31
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:42,420
wearisome sense objects and craving and desires that's the noblest quality of mankind when we

32
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:50,020
have purity we are not contaminated by our world experience that's when we are most noble we want

33
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:56,900
to rely on the triple jewels within us it's nowhere to be found outside it's not

34
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:05,540
the temple a statue or a master it's all within your own mind that's true refuge according to

35
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:12,980
hui nan the sixth patriarch of zen buddhism in summary we want to take refuge in the buddha

36
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:19,460
dharma sangha within us which is the enlightenment the orthodoxy and the purity

37
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:26,660
of ourselves and within our own mind take refuge within means to be in control of our

38
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:34,660
and without it means to be respectful to all others now we will discuss trikaya

39
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:42,740
take refuge in the buddha of our own essence means the three bodies of buddha the dharmakaya

40
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:49,700
the sanpukakaya their narvanakaya the essence body the manifestation body

41
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:56,420
and the incarnation bodies the trochaya is within all of us the physical body

42
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:56,660
of our buddhas the s match the method of movement the scientific research works on thesemos and the

00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:56,820
the essential elements and images its characteristics ofプ quero toil de hoi capitalist art technique

44
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:56,900
takes refuge in the buddha and the Buddha of哦n essence means the three bodies of Buddha the dharmakaya the

45
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:05,180
ours is only temporary. We cannot take refuge there. The tracaya is our true body. So within

46
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:12,500
the essence of our mind, these tracayas are to be found common to everybody. We all have

47
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:19,260
the three bodies, not just Buddha, but an ordinary man labored under delusion. He does

48
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:27,320
not recognize his inner nature. He erroneously believes that the tracaya is to be thought

49
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:33,640
from without. He doesn't recognize it's within himself. So we need to recognize we all have

50
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:40,960
the three bodies within us. The Dharmakaya is our essence body, which is the formless

51
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:49,240
Buddha nature. The Sambhogakaya is the manifestation body, which is the reward body, or

52
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:56,460
the perfect wisdom. The Narmanakaya is the incarnation body, that is my rape. There are

53
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:02,600
millions of incarnation bodies, that's the compassionate appearances responding to sentient

54
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:08,800
beings. It's not Buddha having these, it's us right now having these three bodies in

55
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:15,460
the essence of our own mind. The Dharmakaya is the essence body that is intrinsically

56
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,240
pure in all of us. Good deeds and bad deeds are not related to the real world. They are

57
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,940
are from our good thoughts and bad thoughts.

58
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,140
Dharmakaya is like the radiance of the sun and the moon.

59
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,760
But our bad habits and delusions are like the clouds

60
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,420
covering the sun and the moon.

61
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:36,120
We just need to use the orthodox, the Dharma,

62
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,420
to put in effort so we can get rid of our delusions.

63
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,240
Then the sun and the moon will be radiant.

64
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,180
That's our Dharmakaya.

65
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,620
We have the Sambhogakaya,

66
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:52,060
our reward body, which has perfect wisdom.

67
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,020
It's like the light of the lamp can break away darkness

68
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,780
that has been there for a thousand years.

69
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:02,500
A spark of wisdom will take away our ignorance

70
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,980
that has been there for ages.

71
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,680
So it's all up to our one mind.

72
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,380
Our one thought of wisdom will break away

73
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,020
all the ignorance and delusions.

74
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,980
Similarly, an evil thought will spoil our good merits,

75
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:18,600
accumulate, and destroy.

76
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:25,080
Our good thoughts can expiate all our sins.

77
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,500
So it's all within our one thought.

78
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,500
The power of our mind is incredible.

79
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,840
So believe in our own reward body.

80
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,340
Then we have the Namanakaya, the incarnation bodies.

81
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:44,300
Every thought that arises is a transformation body.

82
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,760
That is my way because there's millions of thoughts.

83
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,760
It's the millions of bodies.

84
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,440
That's my way.

85
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,700
One evil thought, hell arises.

86
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,500
One good thought, paradise appears.

87
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,000
Dragons and snakes are transformations of our hatred.

88
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,960
Bodhisattvas are personification of our mercy and compassion.

89
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,400
The higher realms are the crystallization of our prajna.

90
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,160
And the lower realms are just another form assumed

91
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,500
by our ignorance and our infatuation.

92
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,000
So every thought is a transformation body.

93
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,580
So every thought is a transformation body.

94
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,600
So every thought is a transformation body.

95
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:26,100
Understand how your Three-Body is working is all within your mind.

96
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:30,640
Our good thoughts and bad thoughts they have no dualism in its nature, but that's why

97
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,560
we need to work on it, to remove all our negative thoughts.

98
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,060
Our good thoughts and bad thoughts they have no dualism in its nature, but that's why we

99
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,000
need to work on it, to remove all our negative thoughts.

100
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,940
Remove the evil mind, the jealous mind, the flattering and crooked mind, egotism, deceit

101
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,960
and falsehood, contemptuousness, snobbishness, malicious views.

102
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,140
Remove all our negative thoughts.

103
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:47,800
Remove all our evil mind and good thoughts.

104
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,640
malicious views, arrogance, and all other evils.

105
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:58,840
Remove these negative minds, then we are taking true refuge in our own Buddha nature.

106
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:05,040
Evil mind, including the three poisons of greed, anger, and ignorance,

107
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,260
our jealous mind is a big obstacle for all practitioners.

108
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,180
We are envious of others' success.

109
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,400
There was a very diligent practitioner.

110
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,760
He stayed up in the snow mountains and meditated for years,

111
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:23,400
told great precepts, and let go of all the worldly desires.

112
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,400
One day, one of his disciples went to another temple.

113
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,260
He came back and told the master,

114
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,380
Dear master, your Dharma brother, so-and-so, has reached enlightenment.

115
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,400
Because of this news, he could not meditate and cultivate anymore.

116
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,920
His mind is overwhelmed with jealousy.

117
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,920
So you know the severity.

118
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,400
It's the self-jealousy that's consuming us.

119
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,400
We need to let go of our flattering and crooked mind.

120
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:57,400
At work or in the temple, we might be flattering and not being sincere.

121
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,400
That is not in accordance with our true mind.

122
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,400
Egotism, we are full of the self.

123
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:11,400
Even when we are doing good deeds, we are affirming the selfhood, deceit, and falsehood.

124
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,180
We might be lying or cheating, thinking nobody will know what we are doing.

125
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,180
Behind their backs, all your thoughts are transparent.

126
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:23,180
If you put all your thoughts under the sun, you would be so embarrassed.

127
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:27,180
So do not have deceit and falsehood.

128
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:33,180
Contemptuousness, that's when we express hatred or disapproval of others.

129
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:39,180
Snobbishness, we think we are elitist, we are higher than others, and we have fallacious views.

130
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:43,180
We are so attached and caught up with the world.

131
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:48,180
We don't understand that the world is an illusion, that's our false view.

132
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:54,180
And we have great arrogance, very conceited, and think we are better than others.

133
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:58,180
All these are evil views, evil mind.

134
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:06,180
If we can get rid of them, we are taking refuge in the triple jewels and in our three bodies.

135
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:12,180
To take refuge in our self is to be constantly alert of our mistakes

136
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:17,180
and refrain from criticism of others' merits or faults.

137
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:24,180
He who is humble and meek in all occasions and is always polite to all,

138
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:32,180
he so thoroughly realizes his essence of mind that he will no longer have any more obstacles in his cultivation.

139
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:38,180
This is the Sutton Enlightenment that Master Hui Nan is talking about.

140
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,180
To see face to face, moment to moment,

141
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:45,180
with our essence of mind, then we are at once with the Buddha.

142
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:49,180
Master Hui Nan says, if we really put this into practice,

143
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:54,180
even if we are a thousand miles away, we are always in his presence.

144
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:59,180
If we do not practice this and take true refuge in ourselves,

145
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:04,180
even if we are with him face to face, we are miles away from him.

146
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:09,180
There is nothing we should be afraid of, your situation, your obstacle.

147
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,180
We are all self-sufficient.

148
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:14,180
As it is, there is nothing else that should be in our way.

149
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:20,180
If we take refuge in who we really are, then there is no more obstacles that we should be afraid of.

150
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:28,180
And if we chant the name Amitabha, we will definitely go to the Pure Land that is our own essence of mind.

151
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,180
