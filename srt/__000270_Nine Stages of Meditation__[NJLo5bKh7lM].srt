1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,400
Today we will talk about 9 stages of meditation.

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,400
How do we know if we are improving in our meditation?

3
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,400
There are actually standards we can use to evaluate our progress.

4
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:32,400
In this class we will learn about 9 stages of meditation in order to evaluate and improve our meditation.

5
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,400
Now let's look at the 9 stages.

6
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,400
Number 1 is placement.

7
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:43,400
This means placing our mind inward instead of going outward seeking external conditions.

8
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,400
This is the first step because our mind likes to wander off.

9
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:54,400
Now we want to bring it inward and focus on the designated object of meditation such as your breathing,

10
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,400
such as the name Amitabha or a visualization.

11
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:04,400
So these are all good objects of meditation to train our mind to focus inward.

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,400
What is the secret of being able to place our mind inward?

13
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,400
During our daily lives we should always keep a reserve between our mind and the external condition.

14
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:21,400
Know that everything you are experiencing are not as real as you seem and always keep a distance.

15
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,400
That way when you sit down to meditate

16
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,400
you will be ready to place your mind.

17
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,400
Number 2 is continuous placement.

18
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,400
Now we brought it inward.

19
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,400
We want this focus to be continuous for a period of time.

20
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:43,400
For example, focus on the name Amitabha for 5 minutes without any wandering thoughts.

21
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,400
That's already very good.

22
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,400
At this time we are not too familiar with the meditation

23
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,400
but we are training ourselves to have this focus,

24
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,400
concentration for a long period of time.

25
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,400
Number 3 is replacement.

26
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,400
When our mind wanders off we bring it back immediately.

27
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,400
We establish placement with the object of meditation.

28
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,400
A meditator must be very patient.

29
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,400
Whenever it runs off again we bring it back.

30
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,400
The key is strong awareness and perseverance.

31
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,400
Number 4 is close placement.

32
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,400
By this time the object of meditation is very close to your mind

33
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,400
and the scattered thoughts are frozen.

34
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,400
They are further away from you.

35
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,400
We are skilled at meditation.

36
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,400
We can focus and we are near stabilization.

37
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,400
The first 4 are all placement

38
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,400
which means they are tranquility meditation

39
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,400
to train our mind to focus and concentrate.

40
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,400
Number 5 through 8 is inside meditation

41
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,400
to deal with our afflictions and problems.

42
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,400
Number 9 is a combination of tranquility meditation and inside meditation.

43
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,400
Number 5 is tamed mind.

44
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,400
We need to tame our mind of our desires.

45
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,400
Here it talks about 10 desires.

46
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,400
The first 5 are our attachment to the 5 sensory organs.

47
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:09,400
We like to be attached to form, sound, smell, taste and touch.

48
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,400
These are the 5 sensory organs.

49
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,400
But they are actually deceiving us

50
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,400
and they are actually disadvantages to our deliverance.

51
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,400
We have the 3 poisons.

52
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,400
We have the sense of greed, anger, ignorance,

53
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,400
also our lust for men and women.

54
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,400
These are the 10 desires we need to tame our mind

55
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,400
and reprimand them at this stage.

56
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,400
For example, I can say to myself,

57
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,400
Tracy, wake up.

58
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,400
What else do you want?

59
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,400
Death is coming.

60
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
That worked for me.

61
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,400
But everybody has their own way of reprimanding their desires.

62
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,400
That way your mind would be tamed.

63
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,400
Number 6, pacified mind.

64
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,400
Tamed mind is more on external desires.

65
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,400
Pacified mind is working on our internal hindrances

66
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,400
such as the 5 hindrances that's covering our true Buddha nature.

67
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,400
So these 5 are greed, anger, drowsiness, restlessness and doubt.

68
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:15,400
Our greed is our wholesome mind burned by the fire of craving.

69
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,400
Anger is actually enemy of Dharma joy

70
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,400
and rob us of our good heart.

71
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,400
Drowsiness, being lethargic.

72
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,400
It's actually really hard to detect.

73
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,400
Some people can mistaken this drowsiness as deep meditation.

74
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,400
So it's very subtle and hard to eradicate.

75
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,400
Number 4 is our restlessness.

76
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,400
It's actually wasting our time on a lot of false thinking.

77
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,400
It's like a mad elephant that is unhooked.

78
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,400
Number 5 is our doubt.

79
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,400
Being skeptical and confused.

80
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,400
This is the evil of mind.

81
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,400
It's the evil of all evil.

82
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,400
So these 5 hindrances we need to use inside meditation

83
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,400
to conquer them at this stage.

84
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,400
Number 7, complete pacification.

85
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,400
By this stage, all the growths, afflictions and problems

86
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,400
are pretty much conquered.

87
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,400
Your mind is pretty at peace.

88
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,400
Any kind of obstacles comes in

89
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,400
which means you take something bad,

90
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,400
you immediately spit it out, gets rid of them.

91
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,400
So by this stage,

92
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,400
you are pretty safe.

93
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,400
You already reach a good state of your meditation.

94
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,400
Number 8 is single-pointedness.

95
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,400
This is basically smooth sailing.

96
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,400
So there's no more obstacles.

97
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,400
All you need is a little bit of effort.

98
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,400
Number 9 is balanced placement.

99
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,400
This time you have reached samadhi

100
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,400
or meditative absorption.

101
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,400
This time is easy, effortless and natural for you.

102
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,400
So these are the 9 stages of meditation.

103
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,400
As you can see,

104
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,400
the meditation is a skillful means of enlightenment.

105
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,400
In the Shraggama Sutra,

106
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,400
it talks about Maitreya Bodhisattva.

107
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,400
At that time, there was a Buddha

108
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,400
named the Light of Sun Moon Lamp.

109
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,400
During that time,

110
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,400
Maitreya Bodhisattva left home and became a monk,

111
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,400
but he was deeply attached to worldly fame.

112
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,400
He liked to associate with prestigious families.

113
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,400
But the Buddha taught him conscious-only meditation.

114
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,400
So he went into conscious-only samadhi,

115
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,400
and he realized that the world,

116
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
pure or defiled,

117
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,400
they are all just transformations

118
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,400
appearing from our own consciousness.

119
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,400
All his seeking for worldly fame

120
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,400
completely ceased and never occurred again.

121
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,400
He realized that everything is conditioned existence

122
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,400
originated from consciousness only.

123
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,400
That's when he reached his ultimate goal.

124
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,400
He found his enlightenment

125
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,400
and found his true Buddha nature.

126
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,400
Through meditation,

127
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,400
that's the only way for us to be awakened.

128
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,400
Furthermore,

129
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,400
we have 6 corresponding powers

130
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,400
that will help us reach the 9 levels.

131
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,400
The first one is the power of study

132
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
in order to reach the placement stage.

133
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,400
Study, listen to the Dharma,

134
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,400
and really believe in the Dharma.

135
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,400
For example,

136
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,400
we know who Amitabha is,

137
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,400
and by chanting his name,

138
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,400
that's the only way for us to be

139
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,400
out of reincarnation forever.

140
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,400
So you fire up your motivation and zeal

141
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,400
to chant his name and meditate.

142
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,400
Number 2 is the power of contemplation

143
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,400
in order to reach the continuous placement.

144
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
Contemplate on the Dharma.

145
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,400
What does it mean to me,

146
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,400
to this lifetime?

147
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,400
Why do I need to chant wholeheartedly?

148
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,400
Because I really want to be out of reincarnation.

149
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,400
This should be my last lifetime.

150
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,400
So contemplate on it.

151
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,400
Focus your whole attention on your practice.

152
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,400
Number 3 is the power of recollection

153
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,400
in order to reach replacement and close placement.

154
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,400
The power of recollection is remembering.

155
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,400
Always remembering the name Amitabha.

156
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,400
Remembering your practice.

157
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,400
Like a mother always remember her child,

158
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,400
or a child always remember his or her mother.

159
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,400
So this remembrance is very strong.

160
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
By having this strong remembering,

161
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,400
we never forget our meditation.

162
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,400
Number 4 is the power of comprehension

163
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,400
in order to reach the tamed and pacified mind.

164
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,400
Comprehend, which means prajna.

165
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,400
We have wisdom of emptiness.

166
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,400
Just like Maitreya Bodhisattva,

167
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,400
he understand conscious only

168
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,400
and know that all existence are not real.

169
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,400
They are made by the mind.

170
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,400
Everything is arising by the mind.

171
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,400
It ceases by the mind.

172
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,400
It's like a mirage and transformation.

173
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,400
It's like the image in the mirror.

174
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,400
It's like the reflection of the moon in the water.

175
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,400
So none of it is real.

176
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,400
When you have that kind of comprehension and wisdom,

177
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,400
it will be easy to tame and pacify

178
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,400
your afflictions and desires.

179
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,400
Number 5 is the power of diligence

180
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,400
in order to reach complete pacification

181
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,400
and single pointedness.

182
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,400
By this time, when you have no obstacle,

183
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,400
you just need to be diligent.

184
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,400
It's like you're already on the freeway.

185
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,400
You just have to keep going toward your destination.

186
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,400
The complete pacification

187
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,400
is when you can meditate for 7 to 8 hours.

188
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,400
And the single pointedness

189
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,400
is when you can meditate 24 hours a day.

190
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,400
So it takes a lot of diligence

191
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,400
in order to be good at meditation.

192
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,400
Number 6 is the power of perfection

193
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,400
in order to reach balanced placement.

194
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,400
So the power of perfection

195
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,400
becomes a habituation

196
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,400
of complete focus and concentration.

197
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,400
This is the real samadhi

198
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,400
of the world of desire.

199
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,400
Furthermore, we also need 4 attentions.

200
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,400
Number 1 is forceful attention.

201
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,400
For the first 2 placements,

202
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,400
we need to be forceful

203
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,400
because in the beginning,

204
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,400
it's very difficult.

205
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,400
We need to have a lot of willpower

206
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,400
and give it a lot of energy

207
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,400
in order to start meditating.

208
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,400
Stages 3 to 7,

209
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,400
we have disturbed attention.

210
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,400
We know we have obstacles

211
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,400
and disturbances.

212
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,400
But we know that we keep

213
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,400
this disturbed attention.

214
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,400
We can still progress

215
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,400
when there's a lot of interruptions

216
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,400
and obstacles.

217
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,400
Number 3 is undisturbed attention.

218
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,400
By this time,

219
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,400
there's not much interruption

220
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,400
to your meditation.

221
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,400
So you just need to work hard

222
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,400
and keep going.

223
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,400
Number 4 is spontaneous attention.

224
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,400
This time is natural focused mind

225
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,400
that is effortless and easy.

226
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,400
That's the overview of meditation.

227
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,400
We need to understand

228
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,400
and evaluate our own practice.

229
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,400
Where are we right now?

230
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,400
And what can we do to improve?

231
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
This is something we can all do.

232
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,400
We can all reach the balanced placement

233
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,400
if we just work at it.

234
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,400
In the sutra, it says

235
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,400
all Buddhas gain liberation

236
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,400
through the cultivation of the mind.

237
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,400
The mind is originally

238
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,400
pure, clear, and undefiled.

239
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,400
It might reincarnate

240
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,400
in the five realms of existence,

241
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,400
but it remains fresh

242
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,400
and unpolluted by any form.

243
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,400
For those who comprehend this,

244
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,400
it will indeed achieve the Great Path.

245
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,400
All Buddhas gain enlightenment

246
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,400
through meditation,

247
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,400
which is the cultivation of the mind.

248
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,400
No matter how long we've been reincarnating

249
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,400
in the five realms,

250
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,400
our mind is always pure

251
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,400
and unpolluted.

252
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,400
By understanding this

253
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,400
and keep meditating,

254
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,400
we'll definitely reach

255
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,400
the Great Path of Buddhahood.

256
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,400
So that's the class for today.

257
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,400
Thank you for listening.

258
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,400
Amitabha.
