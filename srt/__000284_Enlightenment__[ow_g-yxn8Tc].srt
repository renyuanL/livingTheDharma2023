1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Today we are going to talk about enlightenment.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The way to enlightenment is ineffable.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Surpassing the path of language, all Buddhas are born from it, this dharma is hard to conceive.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Enlightenment is beyond words and language, but all enlightened beings have three things in common.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Number one, they realize the illusion of the self.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Number two, they are permanently released from the cycle of rebirth.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Number three, as a byproduct of their enlightenment, they possess supernatural powers.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
In this class, we will use Yongjia Master's Songs of Enlightenment to discuss enlightenment.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Have you not seen people whose study has ended,

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
who do nothing, who abide in the Way at ease?

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Have you not seen people?

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Enlightened beings are hard to come by.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
When you see them, they actually don't do much.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Their study has ended.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yongjia Master said,

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
In my earlier days, I set out to acquire learning.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I studied commentaries, inquired into sutras and shastras,

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
distinguishing among terms and characteristics.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I did not know how to stop.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Entering the sea to count the sands, I exhausted myself in vain.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So he became a monk when he was only four.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
He studied a lot and was the master of the Tantai school of Buddhism.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But he felt like he was attached to all the terms, and he was studying in vain.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
That's why he said,

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
An enlightened being whose study has ended, who do nothing.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Now we are all very busy, busy in our reincarnation.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Every day our mind is full of things,

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
full of opposition, full of people who like us, dislike us.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Our mind is very occupied.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
But enlightened beings, they have no one to be,

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
nowhere to go, nothing to do,

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and they have no deadlines to meet.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
They are very much at ease.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
We often say,

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Walking is Zen, sitting is Zen.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
In speech or silence, in movement or stillness,

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
my substance is at peace.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So enlightened beings, no matter if they're walking or sitting,

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
they're always aware of what they're doing,

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
aware of the condition,

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
and it's always residing in their true nature,

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
in their suchness.

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So actually we do not need to do anything,

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
because we already are.

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
We are already there.

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We don't need to add anything to ourselves.

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We are already who we're supposed to be,

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
just beings.

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
They do not banish false thoughts.

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
They do not seek the truth.

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Often we think of cultivation as banishing our false thoughts

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and seeking the truth.

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But Yongjia Master tells us,

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Do not seek the truth.

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Do not call off the false.

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Comprehend both Dharma are empty.

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
They do not have characteristics.

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
False thoughts, the truth,

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
they are both empty in nature,

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
and it's not something we should be attached to.

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Let's talk about Yongjia Master's enlightenment.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
He only met his Dharma teacher,

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Hui Nan Master, one time.

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
He walked around Hui Nan Master three times

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
and stared at him.

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Hui Nan Master commented on his informality.

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
He then replied,

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The question of incessant rebirth is a momentous one

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
that can come at any moment.

70
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I have no time to waste on ceremony.

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I wish you can give me an answer to this question quickly.

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Hui Nan suggested he embody birthlessness,

73
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
i.e. birthlessness in order to overcome impermanence.

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yongjia immediately displaced understanding of it

75
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and then was ready to leave.

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
But Hui Nan said,

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Do not leave so quickly.

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yongjia replied,

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
There is no such thing as quickly.

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Distinction between quickness and slowness

81
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
is an artificial construct.

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Hui Nan was very satisfied at the answer,

83
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
but Yongjia kept asking,

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
A mere concept, an artificial construct,

85
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
can it really have meaning?

86
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Hui Nan asked in return,

87
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Who is it that distinguishes whether it has meaning or not?

88
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Then Yongjia replied,

89
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Distinctions are meaningless.

90
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Hui Nan said,

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Excellent! Excellent!

92
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Now you stay here just one single night.

93
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
That's why Yongjia is famous

94
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
for being the overnight guest

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
that certified him of his enlightenment.

96
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So enlightenment is not really about

97
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
cutting off our false thoughts

98
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
or seeking the truth.

99
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It is about understanding birthlessness

100
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
or non-production or we call just emptiness.

101
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Number two,

102
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The true nature of ignorance is the Buddha nature,

103
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
the empty body and illusory.

104
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Transformation is the Dharma body.

105
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So there are two things here.

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Our ignorance is the Buddha nature.

107
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Our body right now is the Dharma body.

108
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So we do not look for the Buddha nature elsewhere.

109
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It is in our current mind,

110
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
which is ignorance.

111
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It is in our current body.

112
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
We do not look for something

113
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
that's outside of who we are right now.

114
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
One of my favorite stories is about wild ducks.

115
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
There was a master and a disciple

116
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
taking a walk one day.

117
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The master asked,

118
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
What is that?

119
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The disciple replied,

120
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Wild ducks.

121
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The master asked,

122
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What happened?

123
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The disciple answered,

124
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Wild ducks flew over.

125
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Then the master said,

126
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The master pinched the disciple's nose really hard

127
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
and he became enlightened.

128
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What does the story mean?

129
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's fine that the wild ducks flew over.

130
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It is the fact that he was not at the present moment.

131
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
He has been attached to the external conditions

132
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
and his mind was no longer present.

133
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But when his master pinched his nose,

134
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
the pain actually brought him to the present

135
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
and he became enlightened.

136
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
He realized that this whole time

137
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
he has been attaching

138
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
to the external circumstances.

139
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
That's why he is not enlightened.

140
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So in the song it says,

141
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It does not leave where it is.

142
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It is always clear.

143
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
If you search for it,

144
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
know that you will not see it.

145
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It is always just here.

146
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You don't have to go search somewhere else

147
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
to find your Buddha nature

148
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
or the Dharmakaya.

149
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's always right here

150
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
at your present ignorance

151
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
and your present body.

152
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
There's actually nowhere to go.

153
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Number three.

154
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
In the Dharma body's enlightenment,

155
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
there is not a single thing.

156
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So it's emptiness again.

157
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
In our dream, very clearly,

158
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
there are six destinies.

159
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
After enlightened, completely empty,

160
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
there is no universe.

161
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
We are in the dream state right now.

162
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
That's why we think

163
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
there are six realms of reincarnation

164
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
and we are in the human realm.

165
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But after you're enlightened,

166
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
you realize there actually

167
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
there's no universe.

168
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Everything is empty in its essence.

169
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
When you really see emptiness,

170
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
you will not be attached to anything

171
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
of the world,

172
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
even when people slander you

173
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
or abuse you.

174
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So Yongjia Master said,

175
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Let other people slander us.

176
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
We bear their condemnation.

177
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
They are like those

178
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
who try to burn the sky,

179
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
only exhaust themselves.

180
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I hear of it.

181
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's just like drinking the sweet dew,

182
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
thus smelt and refined.

183
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Suddenly,

184
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
enters the inconceivable.

185
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So enlightened person,

186
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
even if other people slander us

187
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
or abuse us,

188
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
we will not be affected

189
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
because we know they are just

190
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
burning the sky.

191
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's useless.

192
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
We hear their comment.

193
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's like drinking the sweet dew

194
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
and we actually go into

195
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
our Buddha nature,

196
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
the inconceivable,

197
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
because we know

198
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
there is not a single thing.

199
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
At its source,

200
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
the inherent nature

201
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
is the Buddha of divine innocence.

202
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
We are the divine innocence.

203
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
That doesn't mean we have a thing.

204
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It just means we are born with it.

205
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It is what it is.

206
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
We are naturally what we are,

207
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
the Buddha nature.

208
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yongjia Master used the example

209
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
of the lion's cub.

210
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
The lion's cub together follow along,

211
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
three years old,

212
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
and then they too can loudly roar.

213
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So lions are the king of the jungle.

214
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Other animals do not come

215
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
and disturb them.

216
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Even the little cubs,

217
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
they know they are the king

218
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
because they have the Buddha nature.

219
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
They are born with it.

220
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So even at three years old,

221
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
they can roar like the adult lions.

222
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So know who you are.

223
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
We are the divine innocence.

224
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You are the price's jewel.

225
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
A price's jewel

226
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
is used and accessible

227
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
for benefiting beings,

228
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
responding to potential always.

229
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So you are a price's jewel.

230
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You can benefit all sentient beings.

231
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Just like Guanyin Bodhisattva,

232
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
observe the sound of the world.

233
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Wherever people need him,

234
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
he will go save them.

235
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So we can all be like Guanyin Bodhisattva

236
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
if we find our true nature.

237
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Number four,

238
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
when one is certified

239
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
to the characteristics of reality,

240
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
there are no people,

241
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
no dharmas.

242
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
The karma of the avicci

243
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
is canceled in the kusna.

244
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
When one is certified

245
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
to be enlightened,

246
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
understand the real mark

247
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
is empty of the people,

248
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
empty of the dharma,

249
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
then even our karma

250
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
of the worst hell

251
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
is canceled in a split moment

252
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
because of our

253
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
sudden enlightenment.

254
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Anybody can have

255
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
the sudden enlightenment.

256
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Courageous donor was a monk.

257
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
One day he went into the city

258
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
and a daughter of a wealthy man,

259
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
a married woman,

260
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
asked the monk to come

261
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
and expand the dharma.

262
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The daughter fell in love with him.

263
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Every time he comes,

264
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
the daughter would seduce him.

265
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
After a while,

266
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
he gave in

267
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
and started having a relationship with her.

268
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
The husband became suspicious

269
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
and the monk actually told this woman

270
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
to poison the husband to death.

271
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
At the end,

272
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
the monk knew that he was going

273
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
to the avicci hell,

274
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
the worst hell,

275
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
because of his serious offenses.

276
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
But a bodhisattva appeared,

277
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
showed him incredible transformations.

278
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
He actually realized the real mark,

279
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
became enlightened,

280
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
and awakened to non-production,

281
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
which is emptiness.

282
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
This is called

283
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
sudden enlightenment.

284
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Just like a room that has been

285
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
in darkness for a thousand years,

286
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
but we just have one light,

287
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
and immediately

288
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
the darkness is no more.

289
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
This is the same concept

290
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
for the Pure Land Buddhism.

291
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Just one recitation

292
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
of Amitabha Buddha's name,

293
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
it gets rid of all our 81 kappas of sin,

294
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
because we all have the Buddha nature within us.

295
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
There was a woman that started meditating

296
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
in her 20s,

297
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
but every time she meditated,

298
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
she would remember her stepfather

299
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
sexually abused her when she was young.

300
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
So every time she meditated,

301
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
she would feel this strong sense of fear,

302
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
anger, and anxiety,

303
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
and she could not meditate anymore.

304
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Meditation teacher told her,

305
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
forgive and feel compassion

306
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
for your stepfather.

307
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
That is the only solution.

308
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And she realized it was truly

309
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
her anger and animosity

310
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
toward her stepfather

311
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
that was causing the pain.

312
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So she let go of all the anger,

313
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
soon went into deep meditation,

314
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
and became a spiritual teacher,

315
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
and started teaching healing meditation.

316
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So anybody can be enlightened,

317
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
at any time.

318
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
We say,

319
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
when madness ceases,

320
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
bodhi appears.

321
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
We might not be fully enlightened,

322
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
like Yongjia Master this lifetime,

323
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
but we can definitely have a great enlightenment

324
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
that will transform our lives right now,

325
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
and we will at least be awakened enough

326
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
to align ourselves with Amitabha Buddha,

327
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
and go to the Western Pure Land.

328
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
So that's the class for today.

329
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Thank you for listening.

330
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Amitabha.

331
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
