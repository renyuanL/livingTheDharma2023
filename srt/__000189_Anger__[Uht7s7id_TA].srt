1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Today we are going to talk about anger.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Anger is a big hindrance that blocks us from being enlightened.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Why do we have anger and how to deal with our anger?

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Let go of anger so that you will be joyful and free.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Anger is the root of poison and it destroys every good.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Let go of anger so that you will be joyful and free.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You have to let go of all your anger.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That includes a little irritation when there's traffic,

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
when you get upset at the drivers or that unreasonable boss, co-workers.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
A lot of people in your life that makes us angry.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You have to let it all go in order for us to be joyful and free.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Especially if you want to have a healthy body.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,000
A lot of our disease comes from anger, especially cancer and depression.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's all a result of anger.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
If we want to be healthy and happy, we have to let it go.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It is the root of poison.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
In Buddhism, we talk about three poisons.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Greed, anger and ignorance.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Anger is the root of toxicity that is making us sick.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
We create the poison for ourselves.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It destroys every good.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
All our virtue, kindness, compassion.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Because we're angry, it's all destroyed.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We have to deal with our anger.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Why do we get angry?

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We are angry at things that's not going our way.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We don't get angry at things that's very satisfactory.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So it's actually anything we consider adversity or difficulties or challenging.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Anything we don't like, we get angry.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So what do we do?

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
How do we eliminate the anger?

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That's the big question.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So we have four ways today for you to deal with your anger.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The first is don't accept the package.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This is from a Buddha Sutra.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
One of the sutras is called the Sutra of 42 Chapters.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
There are 42 verses that talk about how to cultivate.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And one of the verses says someone was insulting Buddha.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And Buddha said to the person,

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
if you give a neighbor a package,

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
if the neighbor does not accept,

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
do you have to take it back?

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And the person said, yes.

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You insulting me today, I do not accept.

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So you have to take it back.

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We have the choice not to accept any package that you get.

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
If you don't accept, you don't open it,

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
it goes back to the center.

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
We're in total control of our emotion.

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
If you get angry at that person mistreating you,

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
you are accepting the package.

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We don't want to accept the package that is actually like a bomb that's destroying us.

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
We have a better life to live.

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
We don't want to let anyone ruin our own happiness and peace of mind.

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So protect your emotion and protect your own happiness

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
by not accepting the package.

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The second way is paying back karmic debt.

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
When someone is insulting us, mistreating us,

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
doing bad things to us,

60
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
it's actually paying back the karmic debt.

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
In Buddhism, we talk about karma.

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Karma means everything that's happening to you right now.

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's a result of our past doing.

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So this person is treating us like this today

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
is because we've done the wrong before.

66
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So it's coming back to us.

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So by them treating us badly,

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
it's actually paying back debt.

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's like all your mortgages or your loans

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
or your credit card debt is being paid off.

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
When they yell at you, it's actually a good thing.

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Once you pay it back,

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
oh, you're going to have a great future ahead of you

74
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
because you're going to accumulate a lot of money.

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You're going to have a good asset.

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
That means our merit and virtue and good karma will come out

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
and all your bad karma will go away.

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So be glad that people are treating us bad

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
because you're getting rid of the debt.

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So that's the second way of looking at it.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The third way is see it as a virtuous friendship.

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Buddha says when someone is mistreating us,

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
see it as a great thing.

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
No one can become a Buddha if you have a charmed life.

85
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Everything is smooth sailing.

86
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
That's not any way for you to grow.

87
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
A person grows in hardship,

88
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
in difficult times, in obstacles.

89
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
That's how you reach your potential.

90
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
That's how your compassion, kindness,

91
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
and your great wisdom comes out.

92
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
In the Lotus Sutra, Buddha talks about a king.

93
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
This king really wanted to learn Buddhism and the great Dharma.

94
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So he announced to the entire country,

95
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
whoever teach me the Buddhist Dharma,

96
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I will be his slave.

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I will be his servant.

98
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
A sage came forward and said,

99
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I have the Buddhist teaching and you should be my servant.

100
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So the king went and be his servant.

101
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
He has to chop wood for him and pick a lot of fruit.

102
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Even he has to let his back be a bed for the sage to sleep on.

103
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And he didn't do it for a day or two.

104
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
He did it for a thousand years.

105
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Because in the olden days, people would live a long time.

106
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
He did it for a thousand years.

107
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And Buddha said, that king was me.

108
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And that sage was Dibbentata.

109
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Dibbentata is a Buddha's nemesis.

110
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Every time Buddha says anything,

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
he will just oppose.

112
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
He's always in contradiction with Buddha.

113
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Whatever Buddha says, he will say the opposite.

114
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And he's trying to sabotage everything that Buddha is trying to teach.

115
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So every Buddha has a Dibbentata.

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You might have one in your life.

117
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
That is a good thing.

118
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You want to consider it a virtuous friendship.

119
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Without that person, you cannot be a Buddha.

120
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So think the relationship.

121
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's a great thing that you have this person in your life

122
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
to help you grow yourself spiritually.

123
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So be thankful of that person in your life.

124
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And the fourth way is called non-self emptiness.

125
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
In Buddhism, we say there is not really

126
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
a self that should be getting angry.

127
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Because everything is based on cause and conditions.

128
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I have this body because of the air,

129
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
the water, and the food I eat.

130
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
These are all conditions.

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And all the conditions change.

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So there's not an unchanging me

133
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
that I should be protecting.

134
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So when people are insulting me,

135
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
who are they insulting?

136
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
There's not really a me.

137
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So who is getting angry, right?

138
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's not a me.

139
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So why should you be angry?

140
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
There's not a person for you to protect.

141
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Our own identity that we think there is a me,

142
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
that is not your higher self.

143
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Our higher self is without the personal selfish feelings.

144
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And when we get angry,

145
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
that's because we're trying to protect something

146
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
that we think is unreasonable

147
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
or it's not going the way that we like.

148
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And that is all the ego speaking.

149
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So understand non-self is the highest kind of wisdom.

150
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And you will understand the emptiness,

151
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
the emptiness of all things.

152
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Don't let anybody control your peace and happiness

153
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
because everything is empty.

154
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's forever changing.

155
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
There's not a me for you to insist on and protect.

156
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Okay, so these are the four ways

157
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
for you to not get angry anymore.

158
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And lastly, pure mind, pure land.

159
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
We want to go to Amitabha's pure land

160
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
after this lifetime.

161
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Pure land is actually made out of your own pure mind.

162
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Your pure mind without anger and without greed,

163
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
without all the poisons,

164
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
you create the pure land for yourself.

165
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Even when you're on this earth right now,

166
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
if you're being pure without any anger,

167
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
then you are creating heaven.

168
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You're living in heaven

169
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
when your mind is at peace and without anger.

170
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Okay, so that's the class for today.

171
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Thank you for listening on the telephone.
