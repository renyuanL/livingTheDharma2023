1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Today we're going to talk a little bit about the history of the United States of America.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We're going to talk about our self-nature. Do you know yourself? Who are you?

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The reason we're meditating is so that we can find our true self.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The sixth patriarch of the Zen school of Buddhism, he was a lumberjack.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
He doesn't know how to read or write. He's a very, very poor person.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
But he wanted to be a Buddha. He wanted to know his true self.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
He went to the fifth patriarch and finally became enlightened.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
When he became fully enlightened, this is what he said, and this is who we are.

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
First, our self-nature is originally pure.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This pure is not the clean or dirty pure.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's just naturally, it's already pure in its own essence, never been contaminated before.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You think you have all these wandering thoughts. Actually, you don't.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
These are not your true self. Your true self doesn't have any of these wandering thoughts.

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Usually, we have the metaphor of a mirror.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's never affected by whatever comes and goes.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Nothing really affected you. You're always perfect and complete and pure.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Your true self really has no wandering thought at all. Just know that for a fact.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So that's the first one.

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The second one is the self-nature does not arise or perish.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Everything in life is based on cause and control.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Everything comes and goes because there's a cause.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
A little seed, we plant it, we give it water and give it sunlight, it becomes a tree.

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So it's based on cause and condition.

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But when the time is up, the tree will die.

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That's the same as our lives. We have our birth, life, and then we have our death.

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Everything is coming and going.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But there's only one thing that doesn't perish if your body dies.

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And what is that? Your self-nature.

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It never got started or ended. There's no beginning and there's no ending.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It will continue no matter what happens to you.

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Your self-nature will go on forever and ever.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So know this for a fact and not be afraid of anything that happens in life or death or anything.

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Because your self-nature, your true essence, will always be lasting.

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Live and be aware of that fact about yourself.

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The third is self-nature is originally complete.

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You're not lacking anything.

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You grow up and you go to school and the teacher taught you, you know, English, math, science.

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's not because the teacher taught you.

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You already know that inside of you.

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You already have the perfect wisdom inside of you.

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
They just helped brought it out of you.

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You already have it.

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You have all the wisdom, all the perfect compassion,

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
all the talents in the world.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So there's nothing that you can't accomplish because your self-nature has everything.

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
If you want to be a writer, you can be a writer.

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You want to be a singer, you want to be an athlete.

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
There's nothing you can't do if you just put your attention on it

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
because you know your self-nature is complete.

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's never lacking of anything.

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
That should help boost our confidence.

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The fourth is our self-nature does not waver.

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
We were meditating.

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
We were on a mountain.

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Your self-nature is like this mountain that is stable,

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
never moving by the outside circumstances.

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
If people ridicule you, they will judge you,

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
or you have a bad day at work,

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
or something happened to you that's terrible, your tragedy.

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Nothing will affect your self-nature.

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It doesn't waver by any outside circumstance.

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It stays true. It stays complete.

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It stays solid.

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So your emotions should not go up and down

65
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
based on what's happening.

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You should decide your emotions and your happiness.

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
That's why we meditate.

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
We meditate so we're fully in line with our true nature

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
that's never shaken by the outside world.

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You're complete and perfect and do not waver.

71
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The fifth is self-nature can generate everything.

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Your thoughts create the world.

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You are the creator of the universe.

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Your thoughts.

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So don't have negative thoughts that doesn't benefit you.

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You want to have thoughts that will help you,

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
help you become a better person,

78
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
help you do things well.

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Don't be negative or upset or be jealous

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
because that's not your true self.

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Your true self is perfect and complete.

82
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You want to use your thoughts to create all that is positive.

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You want to create a beautiful world for yourself.

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Be confident and know that every one of your thoughts

85
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
creates a reality.

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I was meditating last year

87
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
and I wanted to teach meditation.

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And guess what?

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
In September of last year,

90
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
strangers brought us the cushions,

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
gave us for free.

92
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What is that?

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's not coincidence I put the thought into it

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
because I have the self-nature that I can manifest anything.

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So know how important, how precious you are.

96
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Use your mind because you are the universe.

97
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You create the universe.

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Know yourself completely.

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Be confident and know that you can create anything you like.

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Lastly, I want to share with you a little story.

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
There's a monkey that lives in a village.

102
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
There's 500 monkeys.

103
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
In this village, all the monkeys have one eye.

104
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Except one.

105
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
There's only one that has two eyes.

106
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
When he was growing up, everybody laughed at him

107
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
because he's so different, he's weird.

108
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So he grew up self-conscious and really had no self-esteem.

109
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And had a very depressing childhood.

110
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
When the monkey grew up, he said,

111
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
OK, I'm going to go outside and see the world.

112
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
He went to other places and he saw other monkeys.

113
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
All the monkeys have two eyes.

114
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And he's like, oh, I'm not the weird one.

115
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
They are the weird ones.

116
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So just know that you have two eyes.

117
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
That means you are the perfect self-nature.

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You are not who you think you are.

119
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You're not this person with this identity,

120
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
with this family, with this mom and dad.

121
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You're not this person.

122
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You are the perfect self-nature

123
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
that is the creator of the universe,

124
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
that is holy and divine.

125
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It doesn't matter what religion you are.

126
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Just know who you are.

127
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Keep meditating, keep meditating.

128
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You quiet your mind, then you will find your true self-nature.

129
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So that's the class for today.

130
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Hope you enjoy and keep on meditating.

131
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Thank you.
