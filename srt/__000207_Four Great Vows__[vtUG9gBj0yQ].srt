00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Today we are going to talk about the Four Great Vows and their connection to the Four Noble Truths and the Three Principal Paths.

2
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
When we're going through hard times, what carries us through it all is the Bodhisattva's Four Great Vows.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Let's look at the first version of the Four Great Vows.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Number one, living beings are countless. I vow to save them all.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
A lot of us, we're going through some kind of suffering.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Some people, they have money, but they might not be healthy.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Some people are healthy, but have broken family.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The nature of our samsara life is full of sufferings.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We want to help them get out of the Sixth Round Reincarnation and reach Buddhahood.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
That should be our vow.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
There was a master, he brought his little monk on a small trip.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The master was walking in the front and the little monk was walking in the back carrying the luggage.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The little monk in the back, he started having one of these.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
He started having wondering thoughts and he was thinking,

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I want to be a Buddha and I want to save all the sentient beings from this suffering.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
His master and self-enlightened art hat can read people's minds.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So he heard the little monk's vows and then he told the little monk,

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
why don't you walk in front of me and give me the luggage, I will carry it.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So the little monk didn't know why, but he just followed the instruction.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
When he was walking in the front,

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
he started having wondering thoughts again.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
He was thinking,

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Oh, becoming a Buddha, trying to help others is very difficult.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
People are very stubborn and they don't listen to you.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You have to sacrifice your life for them.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Maybe I should just forget it.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'll just become an art hat, be self-enlightened and get out of the Sixth Round myself first.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So he had changed his mind.

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
His master heard it, so he told the little monk,

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Hey little monk,

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
here's the luggage, you carry it and walk in the back.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So this went back and forth three times.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Finally, the little monk asked the master,

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Dear master, how come we keep switching places?

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The master said,

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
When you were having great vows of becoming a Buddha to save all sentient beings,

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
you become very powerful like a Buddha.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So you are better than me.

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
But when you change your mind and wanted to be an art hat,

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
then you're lesser than me because I'm already an enlightened art hat.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So you have to walk in the back.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Just our thoughts make us become a Bodhisattva.

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So have these great vows as much as you can.

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Then you become as strong as a Buddha.

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The second is delusions are inexhaustible.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I vow to eliminate them all.

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Delusion is the cause of our sufferings.

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So you got to be able to control your delusions.

49
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Greed, anger and ignorance.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
If you don't even have power to control your own delusions,

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
how are you going to have power to save other people?

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Just like if you don't know how to swim,

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
how are you going to save a person from drowning?

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You have to have the ability.

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You have to have virtue and merit in order to be a real Bodhisattva.

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So your vow is to change yourself,

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
to change your unwholesome thoughts and your ways

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
and have a lot of merit.

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The third one is Dharma doors are innumerable.

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I vow to learn them all.

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Dharma doors are Buddha's teachings

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
with 84,000 different Dharma teachings.

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You want to learn them all.

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Just like if you want to become a doctor,

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
you need to go to school and study for many many years

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
in order to become a real physician.

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
If you don't have the ability,

68
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
how are you going to save people?

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So you want to vow to learn all the Dharma doors.

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
All Buddha's teaching comes down to three aspects of learning.

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
One is morality or we call it precept.

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The other is concentration or meditation or samadhi.

73
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The third is wisdom.

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So all the cultivation falls into these three areas of learning.

75
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And these three areas of learning are the only way

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
to get rid of our delusions

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
and our defilements.

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So vow to learn everything.

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
If you don't learn everything,

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
how are you going to teach different kinds of people

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
that have different likings?

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Some people like to meditate.

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Some people don't like meditation,

84
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
like to chant Buddha's name.

85
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Some people, they just want to listen to the Dharma.

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So everybody is different.

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So you got to learn everything

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
in order for you to help all sentient beings.

89
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The fourth is the Buddha way is unsurpassable.

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I vow to attain it.

91
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The only way to really save all sentient beings

92
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
is when you become a Buddha,

93
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
not for yourself.

94
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The faster you can become a Buddha,

95
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
the faster you relieve their suffering

96
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
and deliver them to the other shore of Nirvana.

97
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Okay, so these four vows are based

98
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
on the four noble truths of Buddhism.

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The first is suffering.

100
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
That's our effect right now.

101
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Defilements causes suffering and negative karmas.

102
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
We have to learn the path to end suffering.

103
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And at the end,

104
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
we reach the cessation of suffering.

105
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So we try to go from the first two to the last two.

106
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
These four noble truths

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
is why we make the four vows.

108
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
We want to save all sentient beings

109
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
because all of them are going through suffering.

110
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Everybody has a lot of pain.

111
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Feel their suffering.

112
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Then you will have the passion to save them.

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Why do we need to get rid of our delusions?

114
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Because delusions are the causes of suffering.

115
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
If you don't have anger,

116
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
you don't have greediness,

117
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
you don't have ignorance,

118
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
you won't have suffering.

119
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Why are we poor?

120
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Because we've been greedy.

121
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Why are we having sickness?

122
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Because we're always angry.

123
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And why do we have anger?

124
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And why do we have natural disasters?

125
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Because ignorance.

126
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It all has a cause.

127
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So get rid of the cause,

128
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
then you will get rid of the suffering result.

129
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Eliminate our delusions and defilements.

130
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
That's the key.

131
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
How do we do that?

132
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
We have to learn the Dharma doors.

133
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Our morality, meditation, wisdom,

134
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
we're able to eliminate our delusions.

135
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So that's the path to end suffering.

136
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Finally,

137
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
why do we want to be a Buddha?

138
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Because that's the ending of all sufferings.

139
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The end result we all want.

140
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Everyone reaches ultimate nirvana,

141
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
ultimate happiness,

142
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
without any more suffering.

143
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So that's the Four Noble Truths.

144
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Now let's look at the second version

145
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
of the Four Great Vows.

146
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You will notice that they are different

147
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
than the first version.

148
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The second version is based on

149
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
what's happening in our own mind.

150
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Our own nature is the creator of the universe.

151
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So go inward and have these vows.

152
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The first one,

153
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I vow to save the limitless beings of my own mind.

154
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So in theory and in reality,

155
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
every one of my thoughts is a living being.

156
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Because your thoughts create living beings,

157
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
create this suffering.

158
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So every one of my selfish thoughts,

159
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
my angry thoughts,

160
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
my greedy thoughts

161
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
is a living being that needs to be saved.

162
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So you want to save sentient beings?

163
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Save the thoughts in your mind.

164
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So with this,

165
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
you understand that everything is inward.

166
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
That way you won't be attached to anyone outside.

167
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
If you're attached to the people you're trying to save,

168
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
you might be very emotional.

169
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You see people that are sick,

170
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
are going through suffering,

171
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
you'll be crying

172
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
and you don't know what to do.

173
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But if you're detached

174
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
and know that saving your own thoughts

175
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
is actually saving others,

176
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
you will be cool, calm and collected.

177
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You will know exactly what to do.

178
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So this is a great wisdom.

179
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Know to go inside

180
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
and to save the beings in your own mind.

181
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Second,

182
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I vow to cut off the infinite delusions

183
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
of my own mind.

184
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So all the delusions

185
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
is happening inside our own mind.

186
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
We have the Buddha nature.

187
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That's our original self,

188
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
our true mind.

189
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Our true mind actually doesn't have any delusions.

190
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You think naturally,

191
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
my personality is just full of anger

192
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
or I'm just very stressed,

193
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm a very greedy person.

194
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That's just who I am.

195
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
But no,

196
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
you don't have this delusion to start with.

197
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Originally,

198
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
you're pure and clean

199
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
without any delusions.

200
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So know that for a fact,

201
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
then that will give you

202
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
great power when you have this belief.

203
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
The third vow,

204
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I vow to learn the immeasurable Dharma doors

205
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
of my own mind.

206
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
All the Dharma teaching,

207
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
you already have it inside your Buddha nature.

208
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
This is something you already have.

209
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
We're already born genius.

210
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's just like the genius you.

211
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You become who you are right now.

212
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
The same person that don't think

213
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
we can accomplish anything.

214
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
There was a circus fire.

215
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So they opened the cages,

216
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
let all the animals run out.

217
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Oddly enough,

218
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
all the animals that has been there

219
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
for more than three years,

220
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
they don't run out.

221
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Why is that?

222
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Because they've been trained for so long.

223
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Every time they try to run,

224
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
this sharp rope pierce their skin.

225
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So they remember,

226
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
every time they try to get out of the cage,

227
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
it hurts.

228
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And their mind,

229
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
it's already conditioned

230
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
to think that way.

231
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And that's how you are.

232
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So free yourself.

233
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Know that you're already a Buddha

234
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
to start with.

235
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And you have all the good teaching,

236
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
all the morality,

237
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
all the meditation,

238
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
all the wisdom inside of you.

239
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So have confidence.

240
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You want to learn them all?

241
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's easy.

242
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The last one,

243
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I vow to attain the supreme Buddha way

244
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
of my own nature.

245
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Being a Buddha

246
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
is being your original self.

247
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That's who you are in the beginning.

248
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Your Buddha nature never left you.

249
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
No matter how bad you were,

250
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
whatever bad things you did,

251
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
you have always been a Buddha.

252
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So being a Buddha is normal.

253
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
We're just uncovering

254
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
what has been there all the time.

255
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And that's why we practice

256
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
and we cultivate

257
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
and want to get back

258
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
to our true self nature.

259
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So the second version

260
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
is full of wisdom.

261
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Wisdom of emptiness.

262
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Know that we are empty of delusions.

263
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
We're complete and abundant

264
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
and have the Buddha nature.

265
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So this is a great wisdom

266
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
that we need to reside in.

267
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And then the Four Noble Truths

268
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
give us the heart of renunciation.

269
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
No more reincarnation.

270
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
This lifetime would be the last lifetime

271
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm going through this suffering.

272
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
No more.

273
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
This is giving you determination.

274
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I don't want any more suffering.

275
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Life after life after life.

276
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And no control over anything.

277
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You want to reach Buddhahood.

278
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And you can.

279
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And you will.

280
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
So have the heart of renunciation.

281
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Lastly, you want to come back

282
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
to the first version.

283
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Great compassion.

284
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
All these things,

285
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
countless, inexhaustible,

286
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
inalienable, unsurpassable,

287
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
everything sounds impossible.

288
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
But if you have great compassion,

289
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
you have great wisdom,

290
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
you have renunciation,

291
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
everything becomes possible.

292
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You can endure whatever's

293
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
not possible to endure.

294
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You can do what others cannot do.

295
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Because you have this great vow.

296
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So if every day you recite

297
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
the Four Great Vows,

298
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
it will give you power.

299
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It will carry you through all obstacles in life.

300
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And you're definitely on your way

301
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
to becoming a Buddha.

302
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Okay, that's the class for today.

303
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Thank you for listening.

304
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Omnitofo.
