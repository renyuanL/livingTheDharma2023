1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Today we are going to talk about free from suffering.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Suffering can be explained as shouldering the burden of existence.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
All of us want to be free from suffering.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We will take a verse from Zhongfeng Master's Trice Yarning Chanting Service to discuss how to be free from suffering.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Let's look at the verse.

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Why do we call the land of Amitabha the land of ultimate bliss?

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
In the Amitabha Sutra, Shakyamuni Buddha made a bold statement.

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
He said, West of here pass a hundred billion Buddha lands.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
There exists a world called ultimate bliss.

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
In this land, there is a Buddha called Amitabha who is teaching the Dharma right now.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
In this statement, there are three existences.

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Existence of a world, a Buddha, and a Dharma.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The Buddha who is teaching right now.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Existence of a world is to let us know that the Western Pure Land is a real solid concrete place.

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Just like our earth is real and the country we live in, the house we live in, all has real location and is physically existing.

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:53,000
When we say we're going to the Western Pure Land, it's like we are migrating into this perfect country and we already purchased the dream house over there.

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So in the break of our death, we should be excited.

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Because we're going to be migrating to this beautiful world.

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So we should not be afraid of death anymore.

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And there is a Buddha called Amitabha.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Amitabha is the creator of this Pure Land.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
He created the land for us to go to.

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
He is like our father.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
As if I'm a child who is in elementary school.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I know my dad will pick me up from school every day.

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So on the break of my death, I know that Amitabha will take me to his Pure Land, my home.

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So I have no questions and no worries.

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I completely trust in him.

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
He's teaching the Dharma right now.

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
He's not only my father, he's also my teacher.

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
He wants me to be an enlightened Buddha just like him.

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
That's why we have to go to the Pure Land.

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
To be with my teacher, to learn from him, and to become a Buddha just like him.

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
If you really believe in these three existences, you should be able to be unmoved by any disaster.

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Your faith should be unwavering and should be solid like a diamond.

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Why is it called the ultimate bliss?

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It is because all the pains and sufferings do not exist in Amitabha's land.

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Over here in our world, we have three kinds of suffering.

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Suffering of suffering, suffering of change, and all pervasive suffering.

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Suffering of suffering is the common suffering such as aging, sickness, death, and loss of loved ones.

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
All these pains because of unfavorable situations.

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And there's suffering of change.

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
When happiness ends, it becomes suffering.

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
For example, at the end of the party, when the happiness is over, we might be sad.

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Or we were wealthy before, and we have bankruptcy, and now we're poor.

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
That can be a suffering.

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Or heavenly beings, they're having fun in heaven, but time is up.

48
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
They have to go to the three evil realms.

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That is suffering.

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
All because of change when the happiness ends.

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
All pervasive suffering is a subtle kind of suffering such as the transient nature of our mind.

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Moment to moment change.

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
There's never a moment that I stop thinking.

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's never still.

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So that is a type of subtle suffering.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Suffering of suffering is because we're angry at the unpleasant situation.

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Suffering of change is when we're greedy.

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
We don't want the happiness to end.

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
All pervasive suffering is because we're ignorant.

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
We don't understand impermanence.

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
At the Western Pure Land, the condition is perfect.

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
All the afflictions, anger, greediness, and ignorance will not arise in us.

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
That's why we have no pain and no suffering.

64
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So the Pure Land Buddhism is not apart from the Four Noble Truths or any other teaching of Buddha.

65
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
If a believer wants to seek the path to this land, so what do we have to do to get there?

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
A believer in the Pure Land Buddhism must believe in three inconceivable powers.

67
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The power of Amitabha, the power of the Buddha name, the power of one's mind.

68
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,000
All the wonderful adornments in the Western Pure Land is all brought about by these three inconceivable powers.

69
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
First, the power of Amitabha.

70
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Amitabha had eons of cultivation to make the Pure Land for us.

71
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
He went through a lot of suffering.

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
He went through a lot of suffering for us.

73
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
In the Infinite Life Sutra, it says,

74
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Even though I must remain in a state of extreme pain,

75
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I will diligently practice enduring all hardship with tireless vigor.

76
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Amitabha was a great Bodhisattva.

77
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
He suffered not because of his afflictions.

78
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's because he wants to save us.

79
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
He sacrificed so much for me.

80
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I must go to the Western Pure Land so I do not let him down.

81
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The power of the Buddha name, the name Amitabha, has incredible power.

82
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
This name is created by Amitabha just for us

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
because he transferred all his merits and virtues into this name.

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So the name is a medium we can connect and receive all his merits and virtues.

85
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
This name is treasure of the Dharma that is very important to us.

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
When we chant the Buddha's name, it's like when the sun comes out,

87
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
all darkness disappears.

88
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
When we invoke the name Amitabha,

89
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
myriad evil deeds are wiped away.

90
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So when we invoke Amitabha's name,

91
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
it's like the sun comes out and all the darkness is gone.

92
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
All our negative karma is gone.

93
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
There's no more negative karmic burden.

94
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Most importantly is the power of our own mind.

95
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Amitabha, it means infinite light and infinite life.

96
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Infinite light is talking about

97
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
our Buddha nature is beyond space.

98
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Infinite life is talking about

99
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
our Buddha nature is beyond time.

100
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Our Buddha nature, it traverses through ten directions

101
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
and it pursues over three periods.

102
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's beyond time and space.

103
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
By chanting, that's when we bring out our true Buddha nature,

104
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
our one pure mind.

105
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
In the commentary of Amitabha Sutra by O.E. Master,

106
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
he emphasized there's no name of Amitabha,

107
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
apart from the mind of infinite light and infinite life

108
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
that is before us now at this moment,

109
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
and there is no way to penetrate

110
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
the mind of infinite light and infinite life

111
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
that is before us now at this moment,

112
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
apart from the name Amitabha.

113
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Apart from Amitabha's mind of infinite light

114
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and infinite life that is before us now at this moment,

115
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
we will not have the name Amitabha.

116
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:54,520
Without the Naya Amitabha, we will not be able to penetrate and be aligned with our mind of infinite light and infinite life.

117
00:07:54,740 --> 00:08:00,100
So we need to ponder upon this carefully, how the three powers relate together.

118
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:04,640
If we can really trust in him, we have the three powers within us.

119
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:09,800
There was a mother who was very, very poor and had a very unfilial son.

120
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,040
The son scolded her every day, so she was really sad.

121
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,440
She went to a nearby temple and complained to the master.

122
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,220
The master heard of her story and said,

123
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,880
Now you know what hardship is, why don't you sell your hardship?

124
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,800
The lady said, I can sell my hardship? How do I do that?

125
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:33,300
The master said, all you have to do is chant the name Amitabha and you will be able to sell all your pain.

126
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,320
This mother believed in it wholeheartedly and went home happily.

127
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,440
When she got home, her son said,

128
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,840
Where did you go? Who do you think is going to cook dinner? How dare you?

129
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,340
But this time, she's chanting the Amitabha's name inside and happily started cooking.

130
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,620
After three years of happily chanting, one day she told her son,

131
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,880
My dear son, I'm going to go to the Western Pure Land in a few days.

132
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,360
Please stay home and be by my side.

133
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,240
The son didn't believe her, but that day he smelled this wonderful fragrance.

134
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,340
So he stayed home and the mother took a shower, put on clean clothes,

135
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,640
sat in a chair peacefully, chanted Buddha's name, and passed away.

136
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,840
So this mother, she was able to sell all her pain just by chanting.

137
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,840
Why is that?

138
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:25,240
Because of the power of Amitabha and the name itself and her own mind.

139
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,440
Her condition was exactly the same, but because she changed her mind,

140
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,240
she was able to be free from suffering.

141
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,240
That's mainly the power of her own mind.

142
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,240
She was able to know the time of her death in advance.

143
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,440
Because Buddha already came and told her when he's going to come get her.

144
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,440
That guarantees that she went to the Western Pure Land.

145
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,440
When we chant Buddha's name, we really have the three powers within us.

146
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:56,440
Lastly, one needs to look beyond the secular world to go deep into one's true nature.

147
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,440
So again, it's about our true nature.

148
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:05,440
We need to go beyond the secular world, the world of physical forms and objects.

149
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,640
The physical world will only make us more attached to it.

150
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,640
The physical world will only make us more attached to it.

151
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,240
The physical world will only make us more attached to it.

152
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,240
The physical world will only make us more attached to it.

153
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,240
The physical world will only make us more曾ged.

154
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,240
We are completely attached, deluded, and have more suffering.

155
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,240
So we have to look beyond the secular world and go deep deep within our true mind.

156
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,240
Our true mind has three greatness.

157
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,240
Our true mind has three greatness.

158
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,240
Greatness of Essence, attribute, and influence.

159
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,240
Our actual nature.

160
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,240
It has Greatness of Essence.

161
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,240
This Essence is complete and whole.

162
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,240
Even though it's formless.

163
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,240
It's never increasing, nor decreasing.

164
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,440
It's always the same.

165
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:44,320
over how other people treat you or what your situations are. It's about if you

166
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,900
are aligned with your inner essence. Greatness of attribute is about we are

167
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:55,060
all naturally endowed with numerous excellent qualities. We have perfect

168
00:10:55,060 --> 00:11:00,040
wisdom, perfect compassion, all kinds of talents in the world. It's just we don't

169
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:05,080
believe in our endless potentials. That's why it's not coming out. And we have

170
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:10,080
greatness of influence. Our attributes have great influence in this world. No

171
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:15,760
matter who you are, you can be a great influence to the society, to the world. We

172
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,860
give rise to good cause and effect. True nature is incapable of doing anything

173
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:27,080
evil or bad. It's only capable of doing goodness. There was a man in Australia.

174
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:32,800
He lived in a house by a cliff for 50 years. Over the 50 years, he saved more

175
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,060
than 160 people from suicide.

176
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:40,400
Simply by striking a conversation with them and invite them to his

177
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:46,040
house for tea. Just by talking to them, he was able to save so many lives. So we can

178
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:52,300
all do that if we open our heart and tap into our true nature. So in summary, how

179
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:57,920
do we be free from suffering? All we have to do is use our current suffering to

180
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:04,400
awaken our true nature, just like that mother. Chant the name Amitabha to have deep

181
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,040
concentration.

182
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:12,360
In the present moment, the present moment is the mind of infinite light and infinite

183
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:18,600
life, our true self. Trust completely that Amitabha will guide us to the Western Pure

184
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:24,340
Land at the brink of our death. We trust completely so we're no longer afraid of death.

185
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:29,780
So if we can believe and practice chanting Amitabha's name, then we'll be free from

186
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:34,400
suffering now and forever. So that's the class for today. Thank you for listening.

187
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,000
Amitabha!
