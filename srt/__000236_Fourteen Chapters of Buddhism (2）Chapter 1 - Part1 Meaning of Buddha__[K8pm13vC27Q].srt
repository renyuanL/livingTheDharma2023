00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Today we will talk about Chapter 1 of 14 Chapters of Buddhism, Meaning of Buddha.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,500
All of us are searching for happiness.

3
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,000
One Zen Master said, Happiness without worries is Buddha.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,500
So that is the goal we are trying to reach.

5
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,000
With that in mind, let's talk about the meaning of Buddha.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Buddha actually has two meanings.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
One who has wisdom and one who has reached enlightenment.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Let's first talk about wisdom.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,500
There are three kinds of wisdom.

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,500
Number one, general and all-knowledge wisdom.

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,000
This is the wisdom about emptiness.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,500
Emptiness doesn't mean things don't exist.

13
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,000
It just means things don't have an independent existence.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,500
Everything in this world, both physical and mental,

15
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,500
are interdependent with everything else.

16
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,000
That's what we call conditioned existence.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So it's empty of an intrinsic nature.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
With this knowledge, we will let go of our ego and all our attachments.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
One day, there was a mother.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,500
She brought the body of her son to Buddha.

21
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,000
And she cried, Buddha, my son suddenly passed away.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,500
Please revive him.

23
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:26,500
Buddha said, I can only help you if you go into the city and borrow a torch of fire,

24
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,000
from a household that never had a death in the family.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So this mother went into the city, went door to door,

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
trying to look for a household that never had a death in the family.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
But she couldn't find anyone.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,500
So she went back to Buddha empty-handed.

29
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:47,000
Buddha said, you cannot find any family that never had a death, right?

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,500
When there's birth, there will be death.

31
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,000
Everything that looks permanent right now will eventually fall apart.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The rich and the noble right now

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
will one day become poor.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
People that are together right now will one day be separated.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,500
The person that's strong right now will be old and frail one day.

36
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,500
This is the truth about all things.

37
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,000
So you should let go of your attachment to your son.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,500
This mother wouldn't listen.

39
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,000
She cried, Buddha, but I love my child to the bones.

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,500
I just want to save my son.

41
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,500
So Buddha manifested big fire pits around this mother.

42
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,500
The mother couldn't stand the fire.

43
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:31,000
So she couldn't help but use the body of her son as a barrier to block the fire.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And Buddha said, I thought you would rather die in exchange for your son's life.

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
How come you're using his body as a barrier now?

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
This mother finally realized her delusion and let go of her attachment to her son.

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
She started practicing diligently and later she reached first level of arhatship.

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So with this wisdom, we will let go of all our attachments.

49
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,500
And let go of our suffering.

50
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,000
This is the wisdom of our arhat.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Number two, differentiation wisdom.

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,500
This is the wisdom of a bodhisattva.

53
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:11,000
Although everything is empty in nature, but it has its conventional truth.

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Which has its appearance and form.

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So we need to acknowledge everyone's difference and their wonderful existence.

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And tailor toward everyone's need.

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,500
The best example is Professor Li Binglan.

58
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,500
He went from China to Thailand.

59
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,500
Taiwan when he was already 60 years old in 1950.

60
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:34,500
He started expanding the Dharma and established Taichung Buddhist Lotus Society.

61
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,500
Which helped more than 300,000 people learn Buddhism.

62
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:45,500
He also established child care center, orphanage, senior home, hospital and library.

63
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:51,500
Along with teaching Buddhism, he also taught Chinese medicine and Confucianism.

64
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
He was also a great poet.

65
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,500
In one of his poems he wrote,

66
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,500
May the light of Dharma reach far away.

67
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,500
I'm willing to burn myself as a candle.

68
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,500
He passed away when he was 97.

69
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,500
His last words were,

70
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,500
Chen Amitabha Buddha's name single-mindedly undisturbed.

71
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,500
This is a real bodhisattva who has the differentiation wisdom.

72
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,500
And tailored toward everyone's need.

73
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,500
Number three is the overall and perfect wisdom.

74
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,500
This is the wisdom of a Buddha.

75
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,500
Who can balance.

76
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,500
The emptiness and the wonderful existence.

77
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,500
In other words.

78
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,500
Balance, letting go and living life to the fullest.

79
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,500
So in order to reach this wisdom.

80
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,500
We need to acknowledge that we have the Buddha nature.

81
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,500
Which is the synthesis of emptiness and wonderful existence.

82
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,500
In the sutra it says,

83
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,500
Buddha is a realized Buddha.

84
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,500
I am an unrealized Buddha.

85
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,500
But our essence is exactly the same.

86
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,500
So we need to really believe in this.

87
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,500
In the Lotus Sutra.

88
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
It talks about a person.

89
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,500
Who had a wish-fulfilling pearl.

90
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,500
Sold inside his clothes.

91
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,500
Without realizing it.

92
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,500
He roamed around in a state of poverty.

93
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,500
Begging for food.

94
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,500
Until one day.

95
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,500
A wise man told him about his pearl.

96
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,500
He exchanged the pearl for great wealth.

97
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,500
Then he realized the pearl did not come from outside.

98
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,500
He had the pearl with him all this time.

99
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,500
The pearl symbolized our Buddha nature.

100
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,500
We all have it within us.

101
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,500
So we need to use our pearl.

102
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,500
And live like a Buddha.

103
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,500
That's the wisdom of overall and perfect wisdom.

104
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,500
Now let's talk about enlightenment.

105
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,500
Enlightenment is more about the cause.

106
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,500
And wisdom is about the result.

107
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,500
So in order to reach enlightenment.

108
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,500
We need to be aware and realize.

109
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,500
We need to be aware that we have the obstacle of affliction.

110
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,500
We have the affliction that's blocking us.

111
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,500
From our general and all knowledge wisdom.

112
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,500
We have a lot of afflictions.

113
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,500
Usually we call it delusion on views and thoughts.

114
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,500
We have the view that we have the ego as ourselves.

115
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,500
So we are all very selfish.

116
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,500
That's our deluded view.

117
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,500
And we also have thoughts.

118
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:13,500
That's usually full of greed, anger, ignorance, arrogance and doubt.

119
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,500
Especially arrogance.

120
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,500
We are not aware of it.

121
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,500
When Napoleon was the emperor of France.

122
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,500
One day he decided to take a trip by himself.

123
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,500
He went to a small town.

124
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,500
He checked into a hotel.

125
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,500
And he started walking around the area.

126
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,500
But he got lost and couldn't find his way back to the hotel.

127
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,500
Good thing there was a soldier that was standing there.

128
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,500
So he asked the soldier.

129
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,500
How do I get back to the hotel in the city?

130
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,500
The soldier didn't care for Napoleon.

131
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,500
He just casually stretched out his hand.

132
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,500
To point to the road on the right.

133
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,500
Napoleon said politely.

134
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,500
Can you please tell me how far is it from here?

135
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
The man said impatiently.

136
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,500
A mile.

137
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,500
Even though he was very rude.

138
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,500
Napoleon said thank you.

139
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,500
And may I ask.

140
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,500
What rank are you in the army?

141
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,500
The soldier said.

142
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,500
Why don't you take a guess?

143
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,500
Napoleon said.

144
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,500
Are you a lieutenant?

145
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,500
He said no.

146
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,500
Keep guessing.

147
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,500
Are you a captain?

148
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,500
No.

149
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,500
Keep guessing.

150
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,500
You must be a major.

151
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,500
The soldier nodded proudly.

152
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,500
Then the soldier asked Napoleon.

153
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,500
Are you also in the army?

154
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,500
What is your rank?

155
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,500
Napoleon said.

156
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,500
Why don't you take a guess?

157
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,500
He said.

158
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,500
Are you a lieutenant?

159
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,500
No.

160
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,500
Are you a captain?

161
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,500
No.

162
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,500
Are you also a major?

163
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,500
No.

164
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,500
You must be a general.

165
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,500
No.

166
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,500
Keep guessing.

167
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,500
Are you the emperor of France?

168
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,500
Napoleon nodded.

169
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,500
The major's voice trembled.

170
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,500
And said in a panic.

171
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,500
Your majesty.

172
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,500
Please forgive me.

173
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,500
Napoleon said.

174
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,500
My dear major.

175
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,500
You didn't commit any crime.

176
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,500
So I will not punish you.

177
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,500
But I advise you.

178
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,500
You should treat other people.

179
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,500
With respect.

180
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,500
Please forgive me.

181
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,500
Napoleon said.

182
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,500
My dear major.

183
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,500
You didn't commit any crime.

184
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,500
So I will not punish you.

185
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,500
But I advise you.

186
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,500
You should treat other people.

187
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,500
With respect.

188
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,500
And be more modest.

189
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,500
So we need to let go of our arrogance.

190
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,500
Because that is blocking us.

191
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,500
From our enlightenment.

192
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,500
Our obstacle of affliction.

193
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,500
Is like a thief.

194
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,500
That's stealing from us.

195
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,500
We are not aware.

196
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,500
We have this thief.

197
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,500
Stealing our pearls.

198
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,500
And we still treat the thieves.

199
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,500
Like our beloved children.

200
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,500
We need to capture the thieves.

201
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,500
So they will not steal from us anymore.

202
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,500
That is called awareness.

203
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,500
And then we have to do.

204
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,500
We have to do.

205
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,500
We have to do.

206
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,500
We have to do.

207
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,500
We have to do.

208
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,500
We have to do.

209
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,500
We have to do.

210
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,500
We have to do.

211
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,500
We have to do.

212
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,500
We have to do.

213
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,500
We have to do.

214
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,500
We have to do.

215
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,500
We have to do.

216
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,500
We have to do.

217
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,500
We have to do.

218
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,500
We have to do.

219
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,500
And then we need to realize.

220
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,500
That we have.

221
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,500
Obstacle of knowledge.

222
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,500
Obstacle of knowledge.

223
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,500
Is delusion.

224
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,500
That's blocking us.

225
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,500
From knowing.

226
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,500
What we're supposed to know.

227
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,500
So there are two kinds of.

228
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,500
Obstacle of Knowledge.

229
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,500
One is called.

230
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,500
Mineal dust-like delusion.

231
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,500
We have.

232
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,500
Discrimination.

233
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,500
About everything.

234
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,500
To everyone.

235
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,500
And this discrimination.

236
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,500
Is numerous.

237
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,500
Like the dust in the air.

238
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,500
We are not aware.

239
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,500
That we have.

240
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,500
These delusions.

241
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,500
That is blocking us.

242
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,500
From our differentiation.

243
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
With tension.

244
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,500
ABD crowded us.

245
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,500
We are becomingouched.

246
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,500
Stuck in the abyss.

247
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:56,740
them. There was a general in China called Li Guang. He was a great archer. One day he

248
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:02,280
thought he saw a tiger far away so he shot an arrow toward the tiger. When he went to

249
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:07,940
retrieve the kill he realized it wasn't a tiger. It was actually a great boulder. He

250
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:14,100
was amazed how the arrow penetrated the rock. He went back to the same area trying to produce

251
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:19,880
the same result but for the life of him arrows just keep deflecting off the boulder. Because

252
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:26,380
now that he knew it was a rock he assumed that arrows cannot penetrate rocks. That's

253
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:32,980
why he couldn't produce the same result again. So our knowledge and our delusion and discrimination

254
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:39,180
is blocking us from what we are supposed to know. That is called obstacle of knowledge.

255
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:44,660
We have another kind of obstacle of knowledge that is called delusion on fundamental ignorance.

256
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:49,260
This is what's blocking our overall and perfect wisdom.

257
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:49,860
We have fundamental ignorance. We have fundamental ignorance. We have fundamental ignorance.

258
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:57,080
fundamental ignorance of not knowing our true Buddha nature. Our true Buddha nature is actually the synthesis of

259
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:05,140
emptiness and wonderful existence. We have this mean or this middle way of the truth that we call suchness or

260
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,760
absolute mind. We don't believe that we have it. That is our biggest

261
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:15,920
ignorance. We are sleeping. We are in a dreamlike state and don't know we're sleeping.

262
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:23,500
So we need to learn Buddhism to wake ourselves up, to be awakened from our sleeping and dream state. That is called

263
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:30,400
enlightenment. So in summary, there are three kinds of enlightenment. Number one is self enlightenment.

264
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,400
This is the enlightenment of our art hat who

265
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:41,320
eradicated their delusion on view and thought and reached general and all knowledge wisdom. Number two is

266
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,100
enlightenment of others. That's the enlightenment of a bodhisattva

267
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,920
who overcame their minute dust-like delusions and reached

268
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:55,280
differentiation wisdom. Number three is a perfect and complete enlightenment.

269
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:00,380
That's the enlightenment of a Buddha who have eradicated their delusion on

270
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:07,320
fundamental ignorance and reached overall and perfect wisdom. That's the meaning of Buddha in a nutshell.

271
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:14,780
Next time we will talk about chart B and C of chapter one which talks more about our obstacle affliction

272
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:20,300
and our obstacle of knowledge. So that's the class for today. Thank you for listening. Amitabha.
