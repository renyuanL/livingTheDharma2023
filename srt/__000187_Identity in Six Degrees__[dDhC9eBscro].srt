1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,160
Today we are going to talk about identity in 6 degrees.

2
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,000
The question is, who are you?

3
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,160
Are you your body?

4
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,120
How good looking you are?

5
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,120
Are you the social status?

6
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,120
Or are you your talents?

7
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,120
Your achievements?

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,120
Your athlete?

9
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,120
Your artist?

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,120
We are none of that.

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,120
Those are just identity that we take on this lifetime.

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,120
That's not your real identity.

13
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,120
Our real identity is Buddhahood.

14
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,120
We are Buddha.

15
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,120
We are awakened one.

16
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,120
We are the consciousness of the world.

17
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,120
First, it's called identity in principle.

18
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:03,120
Before any cultivation, we have to know that everybody is a Buddha in principle.

19
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,120
Even a criminal, a dog, or even an ant.

20
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,120
They are Buddha originally.

21
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,120
That is the principle we have to believe.

22
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,120
When you believe in that, you will treat everyone differently.

23
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,120
Because you see everyone as a Buddha.

24
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:25,120
And we call this Buddha nature true suchness.

25
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,120
It is the truth.

26
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,120
It's not the fake self.

27
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,120
It's the real self, the real identity.

28
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,120
Suchness means it is what it is.

29
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:41,120
Originally, you are this higher self, the higher spirit of the universe.

30
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,120
Know that for a fact.

31
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,120
That's the first stage of identity.

32
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,120
The second is called identity in words.

33
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:54,120
This is when you never heard about Buddhism or any of the Dharma,

34
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,120
which is Buddha's teaching.

35
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:01,120
At this stage, you actually hear about Buddha's teaching.

36
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,120
He kind of confirms that we are the same as he is.

37
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,120
He is the awakened one.

38
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,120
We are not anything less than he is.

39
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,120
He is not anything higher than we are.

40
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,120
We are all the same.

41
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,120
We are all equal in our nature and we are all the perfect self.

42
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,120
So know that in words, which means you believe in the teaching.

43
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,120
When you start listening to Buddha's teaching, you will be amazed.

44
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,120
I wish I learned this when I was little.

45
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,120
Then I would lead a different life because I would know so much more.

46
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,120
Not just like a scholar, like philosophy or psychology.

47
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,120
It's not just a study that you read about.

48
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,120
You practice into your own life and you change your whole existence.

49
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,120
Know that identify yourself as the Buddha

50
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,120
in words, which means in Buddha's teaching.

51
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:01,120
And then we will come into the third stage, identity in contemplative.

52
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,120
That means not only do we hear about the Dharma

53
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,120
that confirms that we have the Buddha nature, the higher self,

54
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,120
we start practicing by meditating.

55
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,120
Contemplative means we are aware of our thoughts.

56
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,120
None of us are really, really aware.

57
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,120
We are really conscious every day of our thoughts.

58
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,120
But what if every moment, just like you're breathing,

59
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,120
you're conscious, you're aware of all your thoughts.

60
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,120
Change your life for the better.

61
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,120
Let go of the idea of the self and the ego

62
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,120
because the ego is the opposite of our true suchness.

63
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,120
When you're full of the self and the ego,

64
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,120
my thinking and my judgment of the world

65
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,120
you lose your true suchness.

66
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,120
You live a life of misery.

67
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,120
There was a wife in the olden days.

68
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,120
They're kind of poor.

69
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,120
You know, they live in a farm.

70
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,120
The wife likes to go shop in the city

71
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,120
and she usually likes to buy little decorative things

72
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,120
or maybe some curtains and little things to decorate her house

73
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,120
just to enjoy life a little bit more.

74
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,120
Because they have no money

75
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,120
so she usually buys some credit to the shop owner.

76
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,120
One day, the husband went to the shop

77
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,120
and told the owner,

78
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,120
please don't sell to my wife anymore on credit.

79
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,120
She went back to the store,

80
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,120
found out that her husband actually did that.

81
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,120
She was furious.

82
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,120
For the next 50 years,

83
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,120
she never forget about this.

84
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,120
She tells it to everybody.

85
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,120
My husband did this to me.

86
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,120
How can you have done that?

87
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,120
Because she's full of her ego.

88
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,120
She's living in her world.

89
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,120
She only knows of herself

90
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,120
and cannot live in her true suchness.

91
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,120
So when we are contemplative,

92
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,120
we are aware of our thoughts.

93
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,120
What is the ego thinking

94
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,120
or what is our true Buddha nature thinking?

95
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,120
You have to be mindful of your thoughts.

96
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,120
Quiet your mind.

97
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,120
That's the only way to be mindful.

98
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,120
Okay, and then we come to the fourth identity.

99
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,120
Identity in similarity.

100
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,120
After this,

101
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,120
you have some cultivation.

102
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,120
You cultivated three ways of meditation.

103
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,120
You are similar like a real Buddha now.

104
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,120
You actually have practiced a lot of meditation

105
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,120
and you change yourself to be in line

106
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,120
with your true suchness.

107
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,120
And we talked about these three meditations

108
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,120
in prior classes.

109
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,120
So now we'll just review a little.

110
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,120
There's three main meditations.

111
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,120
The first is called Void.

112
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:53,120
Void meditation is knowing the emptiness of the ego.

113
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,120
I am not this ego of my perception of the world.

114
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,120
My perception is not necessarily correct.

115
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,120
That's based on a selfish me.

116
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,120
It's based on your education.

117
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,120
It's based on what people told you when you grow up.

118
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,120
It's not permanent.

119
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,120
The perfect you is permanent

120
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,120
and without all this changing.

121
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,120
So the self that you're using right now,

122
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,120
your thoughts,

123
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,120
let it be empty.

124
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,120
Void means emptiness.

125
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,120
That will give you peace.

126
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,120
When you quiet your mind,

127
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,120
so your mind does not name things,

128
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,120
judge things.

129
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,120
When Buddha was alive,

130
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,120
he told people how to count your breathing.

131
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,120
It's just to stop thinking.

132
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,120
Count your breathing.

133
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,120
It's just another way to say,

134
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,120
don't think.

135
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,120
Don't name anything.

136
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,120
Practice.

137
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,120
When you see someone,

138
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,120
don't say fat or skinny, small.

139
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,120
Small, big, pretty, ugly.

140
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,120
If you don't name things,

141
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,120
aren't you more at peace?

142
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,120
That's your true suchness.

143
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,120
It's void meditation.

144
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,120
Okay, so let go of all thoughts.

145
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,120
Your true self emerges.

146
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,120
The second is called unreal.

147
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,120
So all your thoughts are impermanent.

148
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,120
All your thinking, they're not real.

149
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,120
And this whole world is not real,

150
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,120
but you go on with the conventional life.

151
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,120
You still excel

152
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,120
and be the best that you can be.

153
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,120
And you still do what you think is right.

154
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,120
And you still be great whatever you are,

155
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,120
whatever you do.

156
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,120
A gardener came this morning.

157
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,120
We asked him to cut the big tree in front of our house.

158
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,120
They did it so fast in less than two hours.

159
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,120
And now it's beautifully shaped.

160
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,120
They did this amazing job.

161
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,120
So you don't have to think so much

162
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,120
or worry or think,

163
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,120
I have to do this, I have to do that.

164
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,120
I have a lot of tension.

165
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,120
But you do everything perfectly

166
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,120
because you're quiet

167
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,120
and you actually become more than you can be.

168
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,120
And the last meditation is called the me.

169
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,120
That means you balance.

170
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,120
You let go, but you excel.

171
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,120
You let go of any stress or ego.

172
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,120
Don't think about the self, but excel.

173
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,120
Do everything that you can do

174
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,120
and manifest greatness for the world.

175
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,120
When you reach this balance,

176
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,120
you kind of align with your true suchness.

177
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,120
We come to the fifth identity.

178
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,120
Identity of partial realization.

179
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,120
After the meditation,

180
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,120
you get rid of all your delusions of the mind.

181
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,120
And you partially become a real Buddha.

182
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,120
You get rid of all your wandering thoughts.

183
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,120
At this level, you do not think,

184
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,120
but you know everything.

185
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,120
Buddha does not think,

186
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,120
but he knows everything that's going on.

187
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,120
In the sutra, it says,

188
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,120
how many drops of rain in this world,

189
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,120
he knows.

190
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,120
Because he doesn't think.

191
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,120
He has no idea of the self.

192
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,120
But he knows everything.

193
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,120
When you come to this level,

194
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,120
you are almost a Buddha.

195
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,120
The sixth stage is called ultimate identity.

196
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,120
It's when you become a real Buddha.

197
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,120
Just like the Buddha

198
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,120
that was in India 2,600 years ago.

199
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,120
He reached his enlightenment when he was 30.

200
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,120
We can all reach this level of Buddhahood

201
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,120
if we just go through the six stages of identity.

202
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,120
In the Christian scripture,

203
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,120
there is a verse,

204
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,120
be still and know that I am God.

205
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,120
I changed it to

206
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,120
be still and know that

207
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,120
I am Buddha.

208
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,120
Be still means being without thinking.

209
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,120
Be in your quiet mind.

210
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,120
And know,

211
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,120
know means a deep knowing.

212
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,120
You know for a fact

213
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,120
that I am,

214
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,120
that I am,

215
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,120
which is the higher spiritual identity.

216
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,120
Not this body,

217
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,120
not this life,

218
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,120
not this family,

219
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,120
but I am the Buddha.

220
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,120
That is one with the universe.

221
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,120
All our Buddha nature is one nature.

222
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,120
All of us has one Buddha nature.

223
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,120
And that's formless and perfect and complete.

224
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,120
Okay, so that's the lesson for today

225
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,120
to confirm that we are all Buddha

226
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,120
and we can all reach awakening and enlightenment.

227
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,120
Okay, thank you for listening.

228
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,120
Amitabha.
