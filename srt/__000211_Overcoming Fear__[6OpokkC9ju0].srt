1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,140
Today, we're going to talk about overcoming fear.

2
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,820
All of us experience some kind of fear.

3
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,480
Some people are afraid of catching the coronavirus.

4
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,640
Some people are afraid of losing their jobs.

5
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,820
Some people are afraid of failures.

6
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,940
Some people are afraid of death.

7
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,080
So how does a cultivator overcome his fear?

8
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:40,620
Today, we are going to discuss three ways to overcome our fears.

9
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,840
Hopefully, this will help you transform your life.

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,720
Number one, believe in karma.

11
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,420
Karma is what we call activity of cause and effect or we call causation.

12
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:59,980
So for every good or bad act of the body, mind, and speech,

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
there is a corresponding result that we will experience in the future.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,260
So every moment, we are experiencing the karmic result of our prior actions.

15
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:19,260
And simultaneously, we are creating new karma that we'll be experiencing in the future.

16
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:24,360
The saying is bodhisattvas fear the cause, not its result.

17
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,020
Living beings fear the result, not its cause.

18
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,360
Most of us have fear of karma.

19
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,360
We have fear of the result.

20
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,360
Am I going to get the virus?

21
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,360
Am I going to lose my job?

22
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,360
Or am I going to fail or something?

23
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,360
So we only worry about the result.

24
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:47,360
But a bodhisattva is wise enough, they only concern about the cause and not its result.

25
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,360
They proactively work on the cause.

26
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,360
Make sure you plant a good seed, you will bear good fruit.

27
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,360
So the good seed is virtuous deeds and thoughts.

28
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,360
And that will bear good fruit.

29
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,360
And that will bear you a good life and good fortune.

30
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,360
Our fortune is for us to create.

31
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,360
If you know karma, you will not be fearful anymore.

32
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,360
Because karma is fair.

33
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,360
Everything that happened to us is exactly what we deserve.

34
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:21,360
So you will calmly accept all life situations because you know we are responsible.

35
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,360
You just work on the cause right now at the present moment.

36
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,360
Make sure it's good.

37
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,360
You are creating the best future for yourself.

38
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,360
In the Ming Dynasty, there is a Mr. Yu.

39
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,360
He was a talented scholar.

40
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,360
He passed the first level of the imperial exam when he was only 18.

41
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,360
But he could not achieve higher placements no matter how hard he tried.

42
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,360
He did a lot of good deeds.

43
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:57,360
He even formed a fellowship of nobility and teach people how to do good deeds, have virtues and do wholesome acts.

44
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,360
He had five sons and four died.

45
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,360
One got lost in the marketplace when he was eight.

46
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,360
He had four daughters and three died.

47
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,360
His wife was devastated.

48
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,360
She cried too much and lost her vision and became blind.

49
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:18,360
On every New Year's Eve, he prayed to the kitchen god, hoping for good fortune.

50
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,360
When he was 47, that New Year's Eve, someone knocked on the door.

51
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,360
He opened the door.

52
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,360
There was a distinguished-looking king.

53
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,360
He said,

54
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,360
I am Mr. Chen.

55
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,360
I came to pay you a visit.

56
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:38,360
Mr. Yu gladly invited him in and started telling him about his miserable life.

57
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,360
All of a sudden, Mr. Chen said,

58
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,360
You don't have to tell me anymore.

59
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,360
I know all about your life.

60
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,360
Your problem is you have too many unwholesome thoughts.

61
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,360
And you are a hypocrite.

62
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,360
You only do good deeds in front of people.

63
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,360
When you are home by yourself, you don't follow the teachings.

64
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,360
You don't have any sexual misconducts.

65
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,360
But your mind is full of unwholesome desires.

66
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,360
You are always arrogant, always jealous of others, and always have to win.

67
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:18,360
If you don't reform and change your way now, your punishment will be even greater.

68
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:24,360
Mr. Yu realized that only the kitchen god would know the details about his life.

69
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,360
And know all his thoughts.

70
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,360
So he got down on his knees and started bowing to Mr. Chen.

71
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,360
Soon enough, Mr. Chen vanished into the thin air.

72
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:41,360
From that night on, Mr. Yu sincerely repented and reformed.

73
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:47,360
He made sure he only had kind, virtuous thoughts and actions.

74
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,360
And he eliminated all his bad habits.

75
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,360
Three years later, he went to take the imperial exam.

76
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:03,360
The examiner was very impressed by him, hired him to teach his son, and helped him enter the imperial college.

77
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:10,360
Two years later, he took the imperial exam and finally passed the higher level of the exam.

78
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:17,360
He was called by the imperial eunuch, Mr. Yan, to teach his five god sons.

79
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,360
When he saw the five sons, he noticed one of them looked just like his lost son.

80
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,360
So he asked the boy,

81
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,360
Can I see your left foot?

82
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:33,360
Sure enough, there were two birthmarks on the bottom of his left foot, just as he remembered of his son.

83
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,360
So Mr. Yan gladly gave back his son.

84
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,360
The son went home, saw his mom, who is now blind.

85
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,360
He was so sad, he ran up to embrace her and kissed her eyes.

86
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,360
Miraculously, at that moment, she recovered her vision.

87
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,360
Mr. Yu, he lived 88 years.

88
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,360
He had seven grandchildren, and all of them had prosperous lives.

89
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,360
So this story is telling us we don't have to be fearful.

90
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:13,360
All you have to do is work on your causes, and you are creating good fortune and a wonderful life for yourself.

91
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,360
Number two, remove the container.

92
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:23,360
In the Shurigami Sutra, Ananda was trying to find his true Buddha nature.

93
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,360
He asked the Buddha,

94
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,360
Buddha, when you took me to see the heavens, I saw all these great heavenly realms.

95
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,360
Back here, I only see this little room.

96
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,360
Does that mean my Buddha nature has shrunk?

97
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,360
And Buddha gave an example.

98
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:47,360
If you have a square container, does the air in the square container become square-shaped?

99
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,360
If you have a round container,

100
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,360
does the air in there become round?

101
00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:02,360
All of us are mistaken ourselves for the phenomena and lost sight of our true nature,

102
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:08,360
and limited the scope of our observation with limitations and boundaries.

103
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:14,360
If you can influence the phenomena, you are the same as Tathagata.

104
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,360
Phenomena means the box, the thing, the substance.

105
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,360
If you remove the limitations and boundaries,

106
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,360
you set up in your own mind,

107
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,360
you will be a Buddha.

108
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,360
You are the same as Buddha.

109
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,360
Nobody is limiting you except your own mind.

110
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,360
In the 1900s in America, there was a Dr. Lu.

111
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:46,360
He was a doctor, but he was bedridden for 23 years because of his severe arthritis.

112
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,360
But he never let that stop him from living a meaningful life.

113
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,360
He accumulated all the address of the people that are bedridden,

114
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,360
and he started writing them encouraging, loving letters, cheer them up,

115
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,360
and they will write back.

116
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,360
And he formed this great, wonderful writing club that helps so many people.

117
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,360
Every year, on average, he writes 1400 letters.

118
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,360
He has never noticed that he's bedridden all this time.

119
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,360
So why is that?

120
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,360
Because he removes the box.

121
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,360
He removes the fear inside of him,

122
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,360
and he removes all limitations.

123
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:31,360
And we can all do that if we just realize that we have no box to begin with.

124
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,360
Number three, becoming a bestower of fearlessness.

125
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,360
In Buddhism, we have a Guanyin Bodhisattva.

126
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,360
He is a perceiver of all sounds of the world.

127
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,360
Whenever there's danger, people call his name,

128
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,360
he will come to the rescue without failing.

129
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,360
In chapter 25 of the Lotus Sutra,

130
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,360
it talks about the Guanyin Bodhisattva.

131
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,360
One of the verse, it says,

132
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:03,360
If sentient beings are in great adversity and immeasurable pain afflicts them,

133
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,360
the wonderful power of the wisdom of Guanyin can relieve the suffering of the world.

134
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,360
If you're in any adversity,

135
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,360
if you just contemplate the power of Guanyin Bodhisattva and chant his name,

136
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,360
fire cannot burn you,

137
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,360
water cannot drown you,

138
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,360
poison cannot harm you,

139
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,360
evil robber cannot touch you.

140
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,360
If you want to have a son,

141
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,360
you will have a virtuous son.

142
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,360
If you want a daughter,

143
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,360
you will have a wonderful daughter that everybody loves.

144
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,360
And if you are tormented by greed, anger, and ignorance,

145
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,360
if you just chant the Bodhisattva's name and contemplate on his power,

146
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,360
he will come save you,

147
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,360
clear your mind,

148
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,360
and free you from all delusions.

149
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,360
Why is that?

150
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,360
Because when we chant his name,

151
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,360
our inner perfect compassion and wisdom surface,

152
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,360
and we transform into Guanyin Bodhisattva,

153
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,360
that is a powerful almighty bestower of fearlessness.

154
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,360
All of us, we just have to believe.

155
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,360
So believe in karma,

156
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,360
work on the causes,

157
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,360
and you are creating your own destiny.

158
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,360
No need to be fearful anymore.

159
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,360
Remove the container.

160
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,360
You are limiting yourself with your own fear and limitation.

161
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,360
Remove the limitation,

162
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,360
your potential will come out.

163
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,360
Becoming a bestower of fearlessness,

164
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,360
we can all become Guanyin Bodhisattva

165
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,360
and relieve the suffering of the world.

166
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,360
So that's the class for today.

167
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,360
Hopefully that will help you conquer all your fears,

168
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,360
and transform your life.

169
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,360
Thank you for listening.

170
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,360
Amitābha.
