1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Today, we are on the third day of our trip to the U.S.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We are going to visit the U.S. Embassy in Washington, D.C.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We are going to visit the U.S. Embassy in Washington, D.C.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We are going to visit the U.S. Embassy in Washington, D.C.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We are going to visit the U.S. Embassy in Washington, D.C.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We are going to visit the U.S. Embassy in Washington, D.C.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Today we are on the third lesson of Lao-Fang's four lessons.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The first lesson was about Lao-Fang himself, how he changed his destiny.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The second lesson was about ways to reform.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And the third chapter is about cultivating all the goodness.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
There's a lot of things we can do to be virtuous

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and to change our life for the better.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Here we list the ten good things that you can do to change your life for the better.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
If you do all these ten things every day and accumulate a lot of merit,

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
you will have a great life.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The first is to support the practice of kindness.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
When other people are doing good deeds, but they need help,

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
you want to be the person that helps them out and guides them.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
There was an emperor in the Chinese history.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
His name is Sun.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Before he became an emperor,

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
he was a countryman.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
One time he saw young fishermen.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
They were taking up all the good fishing spots.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Older fishermen take the shallow water.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
There's like no fish.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So Sun actually became a fisherman.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Every time he sees someone, you know,

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
yielding the good spots to the older and the weak,

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
he kept praising them.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Oh, you guys are really nice, really good.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And when he sees someone being selfish,

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
he just didn't say anything.

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
After a year, he changed the whole culture.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Everybody became yielding.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And let the old people have the better spot,

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and the younger person,

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
they just take the harder spot to fish.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
That's what we mean by supporting the practice of kindness,

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
helping others, you know, do good deeds.

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The second one is revere, love, and respect.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What's the difference between a gentleman and a scoundrel?

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's not the appearance,

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
how you appear to be good or bad.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The real difference is the gentleman,

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
their heart is full of love.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And respect for others.

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
There are all kinds of different people.

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Some are like us, some are not like us.

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We got to love everyone equally.

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
For the younger ones, we follow love for them.

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
For the elderlies, we follow respect.

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
When our attention is good,

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
then we can do a lot of good deeds.

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It depends on your heart that is full of love and respect.

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The third one is help others succeed in practicing kind deeds.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You want to help others succeed.

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Virtuous people, they try to do good deeds,

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
but a lot of times they might have a lot of difficulties.

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
People might try to stop them,

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
and a lot of times good people will get slandered

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
and have a lot of criticism.

63
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What do you do?

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
We are supposed to share the burden of blame.

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
If they're getting blamed, share the burden.

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Help take the criticism,

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
so they will have the courage to do more good deeds.

68
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So help others succeed is very important.

69
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Not to be jealous or try to sabotage what they're doing.

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Other people's success is your success

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
when they're doing good deeds.

72
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The fourth one is persuade others to practice kindness.

73
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
We all have good conscience,

74
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
but sometimes our bad conscience gets in the way

75
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and we can do some bad deeds.

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Taking drugs, having affairs, or doing bad business.

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Their mind is muddled and don't know what to do.

78
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You are a friend.

79
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You're supposed to help them,

80
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
persuade them to do otherwise.

81
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Tell them good deeds.

82
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Tell them good deeds will end up in good results.

83
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Bad deeds will have bad results.

84
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So persuade them not to do the bad thing.

85
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
That's being a true friend.

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But it's really hard to give people advice.

87
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
When you give advice, do people actually listen to you?

88
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Usually, no.

89
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So what do you do?

90
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You have to be very, very sincere.

91
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The person's got to believe you

92
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
in order for your advice to work.

93
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
If they don't believe you, they won't listen to you.

94
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So you've got to be a true friend.

95
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Believe in your own power

96
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
to help others change for the better.

97
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The fifth one is help those in desperate need.

98
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Oftentimes, we give gifts when there's no need to give.

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Here's a present. Here's Christmas.

100
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
We give presents that's not necessary.

101
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
We're just doing it just because everyone's doing it.

102
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You want to give gifts when they really need it.

103
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
They're in financial trouble.

104
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
They have disasters.

105
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
They lost their loved ones.

106
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Or they're very depressed.

107
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Want to commit suicide.

108
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
When they're in need, your help really helps.

109
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
When you're there for them,

110
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
or you give them a little support,

111
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
it's not how big or small your kindness is.

112
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's give it at the right time when they really need it.

113
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You help them out and support them

114
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
to go through that bad phase

115
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
when they're going through crisis.

116
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The sixth one is develop public projects

117
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
for the greater benefit of the people.

118
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Virtuous persons do good deeds for the general public.

119
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
For example, build bridges,

120
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
irrigation on the streets,

121
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
and have hospitals and schools.

122
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
These are all public projects.

123
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Even though we don't have the power

124
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
to do so much big projects,

125
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
what you can do is join Red Cross or things like that

126
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
to help out with the big projects.

127
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Then that is a virtuous person.

128
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The seventh one is practice merit of giving well.

129
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
We all love money.

130
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So it's really hard to give up money.

131
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Nobody wants to give up money.

132
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Nobody wants to give up their wealth.

133
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So it's very important you want to give up

134
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
what you love the most.

135
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
How we practice giving things is by first donating.

136
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
First you try to donate your money.

137
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Then you can donate bigger things.

138
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Like Shakyamuni Buddha,

139
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
he actually sacrificed his life

140
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
and fed the hungry tiger.

141
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That is called practicing the merit of giving up wealth

142
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
and become virtuous.

143
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
The eighth one is protect and maintain

144
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
proper teaching.

145
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
If there's no such thing as Buddhism,

146
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
spirituality and like this book,

147
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
how are we going to have standards?

148
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
How are people going to live for a better life?

149
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Change their ways.

150
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
All these boundaries and all these delusions about life.

151
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
How are we going to have good teaching to teach us?

152
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You got to protect these good teachings.

153
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Help everybody that's doing it

154
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
and pass down the books

155
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
so everybody will learn and become good.

156
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
One person can change the whole society.

157
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So believe in yourself and your power

158
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
to spread the good teaching,

159
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
the proper teaching.

160
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And the ninth one is respect elderly.

161
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Chinese culture for 5,000 years

162
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
were all about respect.

163
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
This elderly we mean our parents,

164
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
your boss,

165
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
our superior,

166
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
our president,

167
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
anybody that's elder and has more knowledge,

168
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
have more virtue.

169
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Those are the people that we should respect.

170
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Loyalty and filial piety

171
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
is really big in the Chinese history.

172
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
When you're doing things for your parents

173
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and for your boss,

174
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
don't try to do things behind their back,

175
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
not following the rules when they're not watching.

176
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
When you're truly respectful,

177
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
you will do everything that they ask you to do.

178
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Even when they're not watching,

179
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
you'll still be good.

180
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
That's called true respect.

181
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And the tenth one is love and cherish all living things.

182
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What makes us human is our compassion.

183
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Our compassion is

184
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
our true self-nature.

185
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
So you have to love all living things.

186
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
They all have lives.

187
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
They all want to live.

188
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Nobody wants to die.

189
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You gotta cherish all living things,

190
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
even a little ant,

191
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
a spider,

192
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
a rat.

193
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Most of us try to be vegetarian,

194
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
so we will eat less meat

195
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
because they can be a Buddha one day.

196
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
If you eat them,

197
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
you can be eating a future Buddha.

198
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So we try not to eat too much meat.

199
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Okay, so that's the class for today,

200
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
and we will talk about the last lesson next time.

201
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So thank you for listening.

202
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Amitabha.
