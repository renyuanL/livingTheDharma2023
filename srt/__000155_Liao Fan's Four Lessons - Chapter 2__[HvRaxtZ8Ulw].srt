1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,800
Today we are going to talk about

2
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,200
Liao Fan's fourth lesson, the second lesson.

3
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,800
Last time we talked about how Liao Fan changed his life.

4
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,600
And now we're going to talk about the second lesson.

5
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,400
Exactly what do you do to change your life?

6
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,600
There's actually ways to change your life for the better.

7
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,000
So the second lesson is ways to reform.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,200
How do we reform?

9
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,000
You want prosperity, happiness, good thing to happen to you.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,400
You got to have the cause to have the effect.

11
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,600
So this tells us exactly what to do.

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,600
First, you have to reform.

13
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,400
That means change your balls and mistakes.

14
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,000
First, we have to admit it.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,400
All the bad things that happened to us today

16
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,400
is because of bad things that we did.

17
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,400
Either this life or prior lifetime

18
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,800
or anything that we did before.

19
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,200
That's why we are having this life we're experiencing right now.

20
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,000
If we're poor, because we did not give in our prior lifetimes.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
If we don't have good relationship,

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,600
that is because we did something bad to people in their prior lifetime.

23
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,400
So if we don't want the bad things

24
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,400
to continue, we got to change our way to be virtuous.

25
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,800
Fate and destiny is in your hands.

26
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,400
You can do everything to change your life.

27
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,400
There are four parts to today's reform.

28
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,000
First is three ways of reform.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,800
And there are three methods of reforming.

30
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,600
If your reform has been successful,

31
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,800
there are signs you're doing right.

32
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,600
And there are signs you're still having a lot of offenses and bad deeds.

33
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,000
In order to change our life and change our mistakes,

34
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,800
the first is feeling ashamed.

35
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,800
Reflect on my fault.

36
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,000
A lot of people don't even think they're doing anything wrong.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
At first you have to realize,

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,600
oh, I'm kind of lazy, you know, that's why I'm not doing well.

39
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,400
I want to lose weight, but I didn't eat a lot of chocolate.

40
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,200
You don't know what you're doing wrong.

41
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,800
You have to reflect, how come Buddha can be a Buddha?

42
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,600
He started like a normal person, just like us, with many faults.

43
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,000
But he changed his way.

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,600
How come he's able to do that?

45
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,200
And we're still mundane.

46
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,400
Person.

47
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,000
First, feel shameful.

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,800
When you feel shameful, you can change.

49
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,400
I don't know if you guys heard of this guy, his name is Nick.

50
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,800
He was born with no arms and no legs.

51
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,400
But he can do everything that we're doing.

52
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,800
And he even can swim, he can do all the sports.

53
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,000
And now he's 30, 40, and he's making speeches everywhere.

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,800
Giving motivational speeches to all the young people.

55
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,200
Telling them how to live a good life and never give up.

56
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,200
He said, I have no arms and no legs and no worries.

57
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,200
We should be shameful.

58
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,200
He can be happy.

59
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,200
How come we can't?

60
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,200
We're still having so much trouble and so much difficulty in our life.

61
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,200
So we should first feel ashamed of ourselves.

62
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,200
Second, we want to feel fear.

63
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,200
What do we mean by fear?

64
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,200
Fear means feeling respect.

65
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,200
When you're by yourself or you think nobody knows,

66
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,200
or the Buddha and all the spirits are watching us.

67
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,200
Don't think of evil thoughts.

68
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,200
Or pick a nose.

69
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,200
Or the things that you will not do in front of people.

70
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,200
Because the gods are watching us.

71
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,200
So everything that you're doing is recorded.

72
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,200
And all the good things will have good fortune.

73
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,200
All the bad things will have bad results.

74
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,200
So don't think nobody knows.

75
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,200
Live every day as if all the gods are watching you all the time.

76
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,200
So be good all the time.

77
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,200
So there's a story.

78
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,200
Two people, they think they're talking by themselves, nobody knows.

79
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,200
And first they were talking about all the good things.

80
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,200
They're talking about Dharma.

81
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,200
So all the heavenly beings, they came by and watching them.

82
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,200
You know, talking about all the good things.

83
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,200
After a while, because of their bad habits, they start gossiping.

84
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,200
And all the heavenly beings left.

85
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,200
After a while, they start saying even worse things.

86
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,200
All the evil gods, they come by and they actually spit on them.

87
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,200
All the gods and all the deities and all the spirits,

88
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,200
they know exactly what we're doing.

89
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,200
So be good all the time.

90
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,200
Even when you're alone.

91
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,200
That is a way to cultivate and become good.

92
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,200
So that's the second way of reform.

93
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,200
The third way is determination.

94
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,200
You want to be successful, you have to be determined.

95
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,200
I want to change my way from today on.

96
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:47,200
How come we want to go on a diet, quit smoking, not be angry, and we can't do it?

97
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,200
What's the reason?

98
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:55,200
Because we're always giving ourselves a lot of excuses.

99
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,200
Uh-oh, I'll do this later.

100
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,200
Because of this and that, because of other people.

101
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,200
We have a lot of excuses.

102
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,200
That's why we can't reform.

103
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,200
So you got to do it right away.

104
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,200
I hear about this book today, from today on.

105
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,200
I'm going to reform, I'm going to change my way.

106
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,200
There is a man, he was only 20.

107
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,200
He learned how to be virtuous.

108
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,200
He said, oh, I got to change my way.

109
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,200
He tried really hard every day to change his way,

110
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,200
but he still felt like he's not doing enough.

111
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,200
He kept changing, kept changing, kept changing,

112
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
till he was 50.

113
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,200
And he still thinks he's not doing enough.

114
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,200
He still has a lot of faults and mistakes, you know, offenses.

115
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,200
And so he keeps changing, keeps changing.

116
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,200
All the saints and all the sages said this is a great man

117
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,200
who knows how to change himself

118
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,200
because he's constantly aware of his thoughts and changing.

119
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:48,200
So we got to be determined for you to really have any kind of reform in your life.

120
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,200
Okay, so that's the third way to reform.

121
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,200
There are three methods of reform.

122
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,200
First is changing.

123
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,200
Change through behavior.

124
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,200
If I don't want to smoke, then I just cut down how many cigarettes every day.

125
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,200
You know, I cut it down.

126
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,200
So I change by the actual behavior.

127
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,200
I force myself.

128
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,200
I can't smoke every day.

129
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,200
You know, I cut it down.

130
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,200
So I change by the actual behavior.

131
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,200
I force myself.

132
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,200
I can't smoke.

133
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
I can't smoke.

134
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,200
I force myself.

135
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,200
No more chocolate.

136
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,200
No more cake.

137
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,200
No more sweet.

138
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,200
I force myself.

139
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,200
I don't get angry.

140
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,200
I won't be mad at anyone.

141
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,200
I force myself.

142
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,200
But that is only temporary.

143
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,200
So the second way is changing through reasoning.

144
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,200
If you know the reason, then you will be able to change.

145
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,200
For example, smoking is really bad for your health.

146
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:42,200
Or getting angry is not necessary because when someone is slandering about you.

147
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,200
If he's right, I should change my ways.

148
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,200
If he's wrong, why should I be angry?

149
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,200
I shouldn't even listen, right?

150
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,200
If you know the reasoning,

151
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,200
there's no point being upset.

152
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,200
And there's no point smoking.

153
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,200
No point eating a lot of junk food, right?

154
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:04,200
So if you know the logic behind it, then you are likely to reform forever.

155
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,200
The third is the ultimate way.

156
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,200
It's changing from the heart.

157
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,200
We have numerous mistakes, right?

158
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,200
If you change one at a time, it takes a long time.

159
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:20,200
But if you just change from the heart because everything stems from your heart.

160
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,200
If you just change your heart

161
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,200
to be pure and virtuous,

162
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,200
you will have no more offenses,

163
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,200
you have no more mistakes,

164
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,200
you have no more faults

165
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,200
because your heart is constantly still and peaceful

166
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,200
and you're not having a lot of thoughts, okay?

167
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,200
So this is like meditation.

168
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,200
Your heart is very calm and your mind is clear.

169
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,200
You're not likely to do a lot of bad things or have faults.

170
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,200
So that's changing from the heart.

171
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,200
If you really want to reform,

172
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,200
you need to do all these three ways.

173
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,200
If you combine them,

174
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,200
then you can change yourself for the better.

175
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,200
There are signs of you actually being successful.

176
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,200
You will feel these things.

177
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,200
These things will happen to you.

178
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,200
First, you will naturally feel light and generous.

179
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,200
You have a good mood.

180
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,200
Nothing is happening, but you feel very joyful.

181
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,200
You have a good mood all the time, okay?

182
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,200
And the second one is because of all the good things and virtues,

183
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,200
you become wise all the time.

184
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,200
You kind of know everything.

185
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,200
You kind of know what I should do with everything.

186
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,200
And without any confusion.

187
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,200
And the third is relaxed in turmoil.

188
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,200
When a lot of bad things happening,

189
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,200
it's very hectic,

190
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,200
you're still very relaxed, calm.

191
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,200
Even when there's a lot of trouble around you,

192
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,200
you still feel peaceful and you're not moved.

193
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,200
The fourth is you're happy seeing an enemy.

194
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,200
Usually we see an enemy,

195
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,200
we are very angry or we try to hide

196
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,200
or we pretend we're nice, but we're not.

197
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,200
But when you really reform,

198
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,200
even when seeing someone you don't like,

199
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,200
you are genuinely sincere and happy

200
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,200
and treat him like a loved one.

201
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,200
That means you have really changed yourself

202
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,200
to be able to see an enemy and be happy.

203
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,200
The fifth is dream of spitting black things, okay?

204
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,200
A lot of these are dreams.

205
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,200
You will notice in your dreams

206
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,200
you spit out black things.

207
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,200
Black things means offenses, bad things.

208
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,200
In your dream, you're actually spitting out black stuff.

209
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,200
That means all your bad things are gone.

210
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,200
You're starting anew.

211
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,200
So seeing yourself spitting out bad things,

212
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,200
that's good.

213
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
The sixth is dream of past sages.

214
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,200
Sometimes in your dreams,

215
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,200
you might see Jesus or you can see Buddha

216
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,200
or you can see someone very virtuous

217
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,200
and encourage you.

218
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,200
That is a very good sign.

219
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,200
That means you have become a virtuous person.

220
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,200
So that's the sixth one.

221
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,200
The seventh one is when you dream of flying.

222
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,200
Flying is good.

223
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,200
That means you're free of offenses and evil darkness.

224
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,200
And the eighth is dream of pennies and canopies.

225
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,200
All the decorated pretty stuff like we have here,

226
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,200
that means you are having an auspicious life.

227
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,200
That's a good sign.

228
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,200
All the pretty and beautiful things

229
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,200
that's decorative in your life

230
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,200
that you dream of them, okay?

231
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,200
So these are the good signs of that you have reformed.

232
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,200
But there are also bad signs.

233
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,200
Pretty much they're the opposite.

234
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,200
When you're not doing well

235
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,200
or you're actually not really reforming

236
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
and you're still going out with your old ways,

237
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
this is what will happen to you.

238
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,200
First, feeling confused and oppressed.

239
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
You have no energy.

240
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,200
You're like, oh, every day I'm sluggish

241
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,200
and I don't know what I'm doing.

242
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,200
That means you have a lot of offenses.

243
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,200
Secondly, you can be very forgetful.

244
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,200
You forget your keys.

245
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
You forget all your work.

246
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,200
You don't know where you left it

247
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,200
because you're very confused.

248
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,200
The third is worrying about nothing.

249
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,200
Nothing is going on.

250
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
You're just sitting at home.

251
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,200
But you're very worried about everything.

252
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,200
Nothing is happening, but you're worried.

253
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,200
That is also a sign of offense.

254
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,200
The fourth is embarrassing virtuous people.

255
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,200
When someone is virtuous,

256
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,200
you don't want to see the person

257
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,200
because, you know, you feel shameful.

258
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,200
You don't want the other person to see you.

259
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,200
And the fifth is displeased with proper teaching.

260
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,200
When you hear good teaching, you're not interested.

261
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,200
You don't want to listen

262
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,200
because you don't want to reform.

263
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,200
And the sixth,

264
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,200
when kind, receive hostility.

265
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,200
When you have a lot of offenses,

266
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,200
you're kind to others.

267
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,200
Other people treat you badly.

268
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,200
Even if you give people presents,

269
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
they're mad at you.

270
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,200
That means you're not doing too well nowadays

271
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,200
because people naturally don't like you.

272
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
And then the seventh,

273
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,200
you have a lot of nightmares.

274
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,200
Having a lot of nightmares,

275
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,200
upside down and all kinds of dark stuff

276
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
or you're not flying, you're falling.

277
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
That means you're doing a lot of bad things.

278
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,200
And the last one,

279
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,200
talk incoherently.

280
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,200
You don't know what you're saying.

281
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,200
You're saying like random things.

282
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,200
Your speech and your behavior is not normal.

283
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,200
A lot of these interesting signs

284
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,200
that you can tell if you're doing good

285
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,200
or you're doing bad.

286
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,200
From now on,

287
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,200
after you hear of this Lao Fanzhou lesson,

288
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,200
what we do is we are positive

289
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,200
and we are very active

290
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,200
in changing our life for the better.

291
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,200
Do all that is good

292
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,200
and get rid of all our bad habits

293
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,200
and our mistakes and our offenses.

294
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,200
So the next class,

295
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,200
we're going to talk about

296
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,200
how to cultivate good deeds.

297
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,200
So this is to reform

298
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,200
and the next chapter,

299
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,200
we're going to really do all the good deeds.

300
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,200
So that's the class for today.

301
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,200
Thank you for listening.

302
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,200
Amitabha.
