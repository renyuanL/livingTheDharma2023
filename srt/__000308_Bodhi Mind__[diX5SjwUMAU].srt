1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Today's topic is the Bodhi Mind.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It means to bring forth the Bodhi resolve to be self-enlightened and to enlighten others.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We will use chapter 11 of the Avatamsaka Sutra to learn how to generate Bodhi resolve in our daily lives.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This chapter has 141 verses. We will only look at four in terms of walking, standing, sitting, and lying down.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Let's first look at walking.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,000
When walking on the road, I felt that sentient beings were roaming the pure Dharma realm, their minds free and unhindered.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
This Huayin school of Buddhism, it talks about the Dharma realms.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
There are fourfold Dharma realms or called the Dharma Tattoo.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Number one, the Dharma realm of phenomenon. That's the physical world of existence that we experience.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Number two is the Dharma realm of the noumenon. That means the principle or the inner truth or we call the mind.

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Number three is the Dharma realm of non-obstruction.

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The Dharma realm of non-obstruction between the phenomenon and the noumenon, which means everything is created by the mind.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So all phenomena is created by the noumenon.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
All phenomena are expression of the mind.

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
They cannot be separated. So there's no obstruction between them.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Number four is the Dharma realm of non-obstruction among phenomena.

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
All phenomena mutually contain each other.

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Inside all matters is everything else.

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It is called the perfect infusion or balance without any contradiction or conflicts.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
This is the world that is the reality of the one mind.

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
This is the actual world of existence.

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So when we are walking, when we make a sincere vow, then this vow will actually benefit all sentient beings.

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Because this vow penetrates throughout the Dharma realm.

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And empty spaces.

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
There's no limitation of our mind in terms of space or time.

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Our mind is boundless.

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
In this Dharma realm, all sentient beings merges together.

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You in me, I in you.

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
In a cold winter morning, a lady went to the deli to get a hot toasted bagel for breakfast.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
After she got out of the deli, she saw a poor old man sitting at the bus stop.

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Knowing it will probably be his only hot meal for the day, she gave him the bagel.

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Another customer in the deli side came out and gave her half of her bagel.

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So we should all love and be kind to each other because we are really together as one.

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The concept of the Dharma Tattoo is to help us expand and enlarge the measure of our mind.

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Because we are really interconnected.

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
That's why we use the metaphor of the Indra's net.

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Indra is the heavenly king that casts a vast net down the mountain that extends in all directions infinitely.

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Each knot of the net actually contains a jewel.

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And each jewel contains and reflects the other jewels.

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's a complex web of reflections.

41
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
We call this the cosmos of infinite rounds upon rounds.

42
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So that's why we call this the pure Dharma realm.

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Next, standing.

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:57,000
When I entered a residence, I felt that sentient beings will enter the Buddha vehicle and equal the Buddhas of the three periods of time.

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
When I stand and enter a home, hope everyone will enter the Buddha vehicle.

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
There are three general vehicles.

47
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
One is the vehicle of the Shravaka.

48
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Two is the vehicle of the Pratyekabuddha.

49
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
These two practice for self-enlightenment.

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Number three is the vehicle of Bodhisattva.

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Practicing for the enlightenment.

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Practicing for the enlightenment of others.

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Best yet is the Buddha vehicle which is about the one mind or the Dharma realm of one reality.

54
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
That's the true mind because we all have the Buddha nature that's already present in us.

55
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So practicing is easy.

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:44,000
In this sutra, it says as soon as a Bodhisattva has the initial resolve to achieve Buddhahood, he becomes a Buddha at once.

57
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That's the incredibleness of our mind.

58
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It also says the initial resolve and seeking of the ultimate realization have no difference.

59
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:02,000
However, to arise the initial resolve in the mind at the beginning is much more challenging than the latter,

60
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:11,000
which means that a novice Bodhisattva is the same as a mature Bodhisattva who is about to reach final enlightenment.

61
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The initial resolve is actually harder and more powerful.

62
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's not precious to have.

63
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So that is just to tell us we should really practice this every day because our initial resolve is very important.

64
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And then you will realize you are actually the Buddha.

65
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:37,000
If we recite the Amitabha Sutra, it talks about the Buddhas of the six directions of the east, south, west, north, below, and above.

66
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
They are exalting Amitabha's Pure Land.

67
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You might think, oh, this has nothing to do with me.

68
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
We just recite it.

69
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But this actually means that there are infinite number of Buddha worlds with infinite number of Buddhas.

70
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And all these Buddhas, they are us.

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
We are the Buddhas.

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That's the meaning of the Sutra.

73
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So we actually equal to the Buddhas of all three periods of time and the ten directions.

74
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Next is sitting.

75
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:12,000
When sitting upright and proper, I felt that sentient beings will sit on the Bodhi seat with no attachments in their mind.

76
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So we want to sit on the Bodhi seat.

77
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The Bodhi seat means awakening.

78
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
When we have no more attachment to the world, that's awakening.

79
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
To know that all forms are illusions, that's how we are awakened.

80
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,000
In the Sutra, it talks about a young man, Sudhana, his quest for enlightenment.

81
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
He visited 53 teachers.

82
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
One of them was actually a young boy and a girl.

83
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The boy is named Virtue.

84
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Born.

85
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And the girl is named Virtue.

86
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Obtained.

87
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:56,000
They live in a beautiful city full of gardens, beautiful fragrant flowers, green hills, and clear water flowing through the courtyard.

88
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But that's how they realize everything in the world is illusory.

89
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
That's how they reach enlightenment.

90
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Because they know everything is impermanent and it's just cause and conditions.

91
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So that's what they taught Sudhana.

92
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So we need to know everything is unreal.

93
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That's how we will have no more attachment.

94
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:24,000
When we are sitting in meditation, if we're thinking about the trouble at work, then the entire dharma realm is at work.

95
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:32,000
If we're thinking about the friend that's far away that is sick, then the entire world is over there being worried.

96
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
When we are not present, our mind is minute and it becomes petty.

97
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
But if we be in the present moment.

98
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
In the present moment, focusing on the object of meditation, such as the name Amitabha.

99
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The name actually is in every household, every city, every country, all the Buddha worlds, and everywhere.

100
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Because our mind is boundless.

101
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It has no obstructions.

102
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You will know you are in Amitabha's Pure Land at this moment.

103
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Lastly, lying down.

104
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
When it's time to sleep and rest, I felt that sentient beings will be peaceful and secure.

105
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
In their bodies and not be moved or confused in their minds.

106
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
When we're going to bed, we also want to make vows to help all sentient beings feel safe and calm.

107
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:28,000
When our vows are sincere, at that moment, we are really helping millions of people that are having insomnia, depression, or anxiety.

108
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
When our mind sees true emptiness, then it's free to create wondrous existence.

109
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
That's the incredible nature of our mind.

110
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
This is also called meditation.

111
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
This is called the Ocean Seal Samadhi.

112
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
The calm ocean water symbolizes our pure mind.

113
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
When it's calm, it reflects everything as it is, like a clear mirror.

114
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
However, when the wind of ignorance starts blowing, the surface of the water becomes agitated.

115
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It can no longer reflect clearly.

116
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So we need to be unmoved and stop the wind of ignorance.

117
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Restore the calmness of the water.

118
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Then the water becomes a seal.

119
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Or a stamp that reflects everything like a copy.

120
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Exactly.

121
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
That's when we create wondrous existence.

122
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
In conclusion, our mind is the dhamma realm of one reality.

123
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It is incredible liberation.

124
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:35,000
When we make sincere vows in our daily actions, such as walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, we are experiencing life as a Buddha.

125
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
When we practice one verse of the sutra,

126
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
we are actually practicing the sutra in its entirety.

127
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
We unite and merge with the sutra completely.

128
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You are really a Buddha and all your bodhi vows and wishes will come true.

129
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
That's the class for today.

130
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Thank you for listening.

131
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Amitabha.
