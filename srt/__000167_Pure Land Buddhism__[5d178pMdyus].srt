00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Today we are going to talk about Pure Land Buddhism.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
What is the Pure Land Buddhism?

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Basically, it's when we believe in the Amitabha Sutra.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It says your passing hours, if you chant Amitabha Buddha's name,

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
he will take us to his Pure Land where there's no more reincarnation

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and you are bound to become a Buddha.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
There are three parts to this Pure Land Buddhism.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The first is faith, the second is vow, and the third is practice.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So if you have faith, vow, and practice,

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
you'll definitely go to the Western Pure Land.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Let's talk about these three pillars of Pure Land Buddhism.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
First, you have to have faith.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
This faith is believing in the Six Truths.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This is not just the religious faith.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
This is the faith about some very important truth about the universe.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
First, you have to have faith

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
in oneself.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Oneself, we mean you have faith in that you have the Buddha nature

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
so you are the same as all the Buddha that already reached Buddhahood.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
There is a person, one day he passed by this farm

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and then he noticed in this farm there's all the chicken.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
There's actually one eagle.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But the eagle, he behaved just like a chicken.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You know, he's raised in here and then feel like he's a chicken.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So this person asked the farmer,

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Can I buy this eagle?

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I want this eagle to fly.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
He bought the eagle and he brought the eagle up to the mountain

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and said to the eagle,

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You are an eagle. You are not a chicken.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So please fly.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And every time he tried to make him fly,

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
he just kept falling because he thinks he's a chicken.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Then the person brought the eagle higher up in the mountain

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and said to this eagle,

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You are an eagle. You should fly.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But he kept falling.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Lastly, he brought him to the top of the mountain

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and said to the eagle,

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You are an eagle. You should fly.

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And finally he opened up his wings and started flying.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So are we a chicken or are we an eagle?

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
We are actually all born as eagles because we are all Buddha.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We all have the Buddha nature just like all Buddhas.

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So we are the same as Buddha.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's just that we haven't believed

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
and faith in our own nature.

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
First, believe that you have the Buddha nature.

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Second, is to believe in others.

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
This is a pair, this is a pair, this is a pair.

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So believe in your own power and your own strength as a Buddha.

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And also believe that outside of you, there is outside forces.

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Buddhas, they actually exist.

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
There's really an Amitabha Buddha.

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
He actually really created the Pure Land

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
for us to go to because he knows

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
that we cannot reach Buddhahood by our own strength.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We need someone's help.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So he created the perfect school.

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Over there, you are not likely to have any defilements

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
because the environment is perfect.

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You're in this perfect place to cultivate into Buddhahood.

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So believe that Buddha is always with you.

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
If you chant his name, he will come help you.

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
If you really believe in Buddha,

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
if you are taking a test,

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
if you chant his name, you should feel very well, at peace.

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You shouldn't be nervous anymore.

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Or if there's earthquake or something happened,

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
if you really believe in the Buddha,

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
you chant his name, you should not be afraid anymore.

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So that is true belief.

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Have faith in the Buddha's power.

76
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The third is to believe in the causes.

77
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
All the good deeds is a cause and you will have good effect.

78
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Cause and effect go together.

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So what's the cause?

80
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
If you chant the Buddha's name, that is a cause.

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So no matter when or where you chant the Buddha's name,

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
that is a good cause.

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The good cause will give you effect.

84
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The effect is owing to the Pure Land and reach Buddhahood.

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So you gotta believe, have faith in the cause and the effect.

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That is for real.

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
In the Lotus Sutra,

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
when Shakyamuni Buddha was around,

89
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
you know, 2600 years ago in India,

90
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
one time there was an old man.

91
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
He went to the Buddha's place.

92
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
But Buddha was not there that day.

93
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So he asked the disciple,

94
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
can I become a monk?

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Then all the disciples, they sat and started meditating,

96
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
tried to see the old man's past,

97
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
to see if he has any affinity with Buddha.

98
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
They looked and looked.

99
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
This old man, he has no affinity with Buddha

100
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
in 80,000 Kelpas.

101
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
That's a long, long, long, long time.

102
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So they said to the old man,

103
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm sorry, you shouldn't try to be a monk

104
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
because it's pointless.

105
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You have no affinity with Buddha

106
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
through your past lifetime.

107
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So there's no point for you to become a monk.

108
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So the old man started crying

109
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
because, oh, I really want to be a monk.

110
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And Shakyamuni Buddha came back

111
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
and he asked the old man,

112
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
why are you crying?

113
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
He said, oh, because your disciples,

114
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
they tell me I cannot be a monk

115
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
because I have no affinity with Buddha.

116
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Buddha said to his disciple,

117
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
you guys are wrong.

118
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Before 80,000 Kelpas ago,

119
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
this person, he was a lumberjack.

120
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
One time, he went to the mountains

121
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
and there was a big tiger.

122
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The big tiger was chasing him.

123
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So he was really, really afraid.

124
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
He went up to the tree and he said,

125
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
homage to Buddha.

126
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So with that one homage to Buddha,

127
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
this lifetime,

128
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
he can be a monk.

129
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And he will reach Buddhahood

130
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
because of that one chanting.

131
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Believe that any affinity

132
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
we build by chanting Buddha's name

133
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
is a big miraculous cause

134
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
that will give you miraculous results

135
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
of becoming a Buddha

136
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
and going to the Pure Land.

137
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The fifth and the sixth,

138
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
believe in the inner truth

139
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
and the phenomena.

140
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
The inner truth

141
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
creates the physical reality.

142
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Every physical reality

143
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
is created by our own mind.

144
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So for example,

145
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
there was this person,

146
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
his whole life,

147
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
he's very, very sincere.

148
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
He's chanting.

149
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And one day, he got sick.

150
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
One day, he was chanting

151
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
and he told his family member,

152
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
hey, our living room over there,

153
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
it's the Western Pure Land.

154
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Amitabha is there

155
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
and his lotus flower.

156
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And you know,

157
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
our grandchild that passed away a while ago,

158
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
he is also there next to Buddha.

159
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Next to the water,

160
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
playing and bowing to Buddha.

161
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So who created this?

162
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Actually, his pure mind

163
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
created the Pure Land.

164
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
He is actually here,

165
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
but he's actually already in the Pure Land.

166
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So we say a pure mind

167
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
creates the Pure Land.

168
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
If our mind is pure right now,

169
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
we are already at the Pure Land.

170
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
All physical locations

171
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
are created by our heart.

172
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So have a peaceful,

173
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
and virtuous,

174
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and compassionate heart,

175
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
then we create a wonderful life

176
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
and a physical existence.

177
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So believe in the six things.

178
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
After you have strong belief,

179
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
you should have vows.

180
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What's vow?

181
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Vow means something you really want.

182
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
In this lifetime,

183
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
some people want to be a doctor,

184
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
some people want to be a singer,

185
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
some people want to be artist,

186
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
some people want to be a president.

187
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Now that's their life goal.

188
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Okay, life goal.

189
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But what is our life goal?

190
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
What is your life goal?

191
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
What do you want to be?

192
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Our life goal is to reach Buddhahood,

193
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
to become a Buddha.

194
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That's our goal.

195
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
With this vow,

196
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
there's two parts to it.

197
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
First,

198
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
you gotta detach from the mundane world.

199
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
In order to reach Buddhahood,

200
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
first you have to let go of

201
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
your attachment to the current world.

202
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Doesn't mean you should hate your life right now,

203
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
it just means you should let go of your ego

204
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
and your selfishness.

205
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Attaching to this world means

206
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
attaching to all your belongings right now.

207
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
If you're always attached to this selfish life,

208
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
you'll never reach Buddhahood.

209
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You have to detach yourself

210
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
from all the worldly desires.

211
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
By being selfish and have a lot of ego

212
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
and worldly desire,

213
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
you'll never reach Buddhahood.

214
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So realize that now as the first vow.

215
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And the second part is seeking the pure land.

216
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You wanna be detached

217
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
from all your ego and defilements.

218
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And you want to seek the pure land

219
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
that symbolizes you want to seek Buddhahood.

220
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You want to become enlightened.

221
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You wanna have the perfect complete wisdom.

222
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You wanna be the same as Buddha

223
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
that can help all sentient beings

224
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
get out of the six realms of reincarnation.

225
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
That is a very heroic mission.

226
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
We all should be on purpose

227
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
and have a heroic mission.

228
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
For ourselves.

229
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
That this lifetime,

230
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm reaching toward my Buddhahood.

231
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Because I have the Buddha nature

232
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
and if I work hard at it,

233
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
cultivate, chant Buddha's name

234
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
and reaching for the pure land,

235
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I can do it.

236
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Okay, so the vow is something

237
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
that you really want for yourself.

238
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And that is what we want to be good at.

239
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So after you have faith and you have vow,

240
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
you will do it.

241
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Your practice.

242
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
The practice part is actually the easy part.

243
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Faith and the vow is actually the hard part.

244
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The practice is actually easy.

245
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
All you have to do is reciting Amitabha's name

246
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
single-mindedly.

247
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
This practice is actually very easy.

248
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
All you have to do is say his name.

249
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Amitabha, Amitabha, Amitabha.

250
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Why do we do that?

251
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
His name means I should be awakened.

252
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I wanna be enlightened.

253
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Every time you chant his name,

254
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
you should say to yourself,

255
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I want to reach Buddhahood.

256
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So whenever if you're angry

257
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
and you chant Amitabha,

258
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
it should remind you,

259
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I should stop being angry.

260
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's not right.

261
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
A Buddha is not angry.

262
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I want to be enlightened.

263
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I should be awakened.

264
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So by chanting his name constantly

265
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
and single-mindedly,

266
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
that means we're always mindful

267
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
of our actions and our words.

268
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
We want to be just like Buddha,

269
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
just like you think about your mom.

270
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You don't have to say mom, mom, mom, mom.

271
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You don't have to chant her name all the time.

272
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But you remember what your mom teaches you.

273
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You shouldn't fight with other people.

274
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You should be kind to others.

275
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You always remember your mom's teaching.

276
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Just like you always remember Buddha's teaching.

277
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
That is called chanting his name.

278
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
If you do that all the time,

279
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
then definitely Amitabha Buddha

280
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
will come get you.

281
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
At the end of your life,

282
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
you will have your own lotus flower

283
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
and he will bring you to the Western Pure Land

284
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
you can cultivate into Buddhahood.

285
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
By knowing the faith and vow and practice

286
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
and actually do it in this lifetime,

287
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
you already won the lottery

288
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
because you are all set.

289
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You're guaranteed into Buddhahood.

290
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Once you get there, you're guaranteed.

291
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So nothing is better than this.

292
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
This is the secret of life.

293
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
If you really understood,

294
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
really take into heart,

295
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
you will change your whole life

296
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
and you'll definitely reach Buddhahood.

297
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Not only this lifetime,

298
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
you will have Buddha's blessing

299
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
and you will have a great life.

300
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
After this lifetime,

301
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
you're gonna go to Pure Land

302
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
and become a Buddha.

303
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
So nothing is more happier than this.

304
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Okay, so that's the class for today.

305
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Thank you for listening.

306
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Amitabha.
