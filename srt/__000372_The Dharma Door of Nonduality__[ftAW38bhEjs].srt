1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Today we are going to talk about the Dharma door of non-duality.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This is from the Mimalakirti Sutra.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It talks about the concept of non-duality.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Hopefully it will help us live a life that follows wisdom and happiness.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
In terms of non-duality, first we have to talk about the two truths.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
One is called the ultimate truth.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Two is called the conventional truth.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The ultimate truth is what we call the absolute truth.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The conventional truth is what we call the relative truth.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So everything has two aspects.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The ultimate truth, the thing that is invisible, that is its essence.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And there is always the conventional truth, what appears in form.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What we can see that is visible.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So one is substance, that is invisible, that is the heart, that is the mind.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And one is the form, that is visible, that is the phenomenon.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So this is the inner truth, this is the phenomenon.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So in terms of phenomenon,

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
it's always in duality,

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,000
such as pure, impure, transcendental, mundane, attention, distraction.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Good, evil, self, others, large, small.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Non-duality, duality.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We need to see the world without duality

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
because they are in oppositions.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Oppositions, they are not the essence.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
They always have obstructions.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We want to live in this conventional world

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
but enter into the substance,

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
the inner truth, the mind of all things.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's why we call enlightenment.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Forms always have forms.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Because of conditions arising,

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
substance is without forms.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It is what it is.

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So they are not the same, but they are not different.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
They are not apart from each other.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You always have form.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You always have substance.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You just need to see that the forms are illusory.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
They are unreal.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Then you will see the true substance,

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
the true inner truth.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
We will explain this non-duality

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
in terms of the two truths

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
with examples from chapters of the Mimalakirti Sutra.

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
First, let's look at the difference

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
between pure and impure.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
In the very first chapter,

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
it talks about the pure land.

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
How does the pure land come about?

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
If our mind is pure,

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
then the land is pure.

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The land is the result of the cause,

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
which is always our mind.

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So if you want to make this world a better place,

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
you change your mind.

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You purify your mind.

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That's called true pure land.

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
After Sariputra heard this,

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
he had a thought.

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
This world is so impure.

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Shakyamuni Buddha must be such an impure bodhisattva.

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
That's why this world is so corrupted.

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Buddha is all-knowing.

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
He heard his thought.

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Buddha said,

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Sariputra, do not think this world is impure.

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
This world is impure

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
only because your mind is impure.

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
If you will only see how I see this world,

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
so Buddha put his big toe on the ground.

71
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
All of a sudden,

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
everybody saw this world as Buddha sees it.

73
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's full of splendors, virtues, and precious jewels.

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's the most beautiful, perfect world.

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Sariputra realized,

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I never saw this world as Buddha saw it.

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The world is pure to the extent that your mind is pure.

78
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So the difference between pure

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
and impure,

80
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
it's only your mind.

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So that's the first chapter.

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Now let's talk about transcendental and mundane.

83
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Some people might want to live in the monastics,

84
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
thinking that's better to cultivate.

85
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
They don't want to be in this world

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
full of ordinary people with worldly desires.

87
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The second chapter,

88
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
layman Mimalakarti.

89
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
He is not a monk.

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
He's a super wealthy businessman with wife and children.

91
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But he is more religious than any monk that we know.

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
He goes to brothels to demonstrate the evil of sexual desires.

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And he goes to casinos to teach them not to be attached to gambling.

94
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And he goes to bars to teach drunks to have mindfulness.

95
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
He can mix into any crowd

96
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
and eloquently expand the Dharma.

97
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
He lives in non-duality.

98
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
To him, there is no difference between being a layman

99
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
or being in the monastics

100
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
because his mind is so firm in the Dharma.

101
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So that's the second chapter.

102
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The third chapter,

103
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
duality of attention and distraction.

104
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
We often sit in quiet meditation,

105
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
put our attention on mindfulness.

106
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We think that's the best way to cultivate.

107
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But in the sutra,

108
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
it talks about how distraction and attention are not so different.

109
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
In the third chapter,

110
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Mimalakarti manifested to be sick

111
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
in order to expand incredible Dharma.

112
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
All Buddha's disciples,

113
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
they were all reluctant to pay him a visit

114
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
because Mimalakarti always corrected their Dharma.

115
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
For example,

116
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Shraputra,

117
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
one time he was sitting under a tree meditating.

118
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Mimalakarti came and said,

119
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
that's not the way to absorb in contemplation.

120
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
That's not how you meditate.

121
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You should meditate in such a way

122
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
that you manifest ordinary behavior

123
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
without forsaking cessation.

124
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Which means you should just be in meditation

125
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
in your daily experience

126
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
while sitting, standing, eating,

127
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
in ordinary behaviors.

128
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And also,

129
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
you should absorb in contemplation

130
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
so the mind is neither settled within

131
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
nor moves without in the external form.

132
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
There is no difference between attention and distraction.

133
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's all how your mind is dwelling

134
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
in the non-duality

135
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
of your one true mind,

136
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
your true suchness.

137
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Now let's talk about the duality

138
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
in terms of good and evil.

139
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
One of the Bodhisattva,

140
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
his name is maintained in the world.

141
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
One time he was at home.

142
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Mara disguised himself as Indra,

143
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
the god,

144
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
appeared with 12,000 goddesses.

145
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And he said,

146
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I would like to give these goddesses to you.

147
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
This Bodhisattva said,

148
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm a cultivator.

149
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's not proper for me to have these goddesses.

150
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
All of a sudden,

151
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Vimala Kirti appeared and said,

152
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
This is not Indra.

153
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
This is actually Mara.

154
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
He is trying to ridicule you

155
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
to give you these goddesses.

156
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Mara is very distressed

157
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
and he wanted to flee.

158
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But a voice in the sky said,

159
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You better give the 12,000 goddesses to him

160
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
then you can leave.

161
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So he gave the goddesses

162
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
to Vimala Kirti.

163
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Vimala Kirti started teaching these goddesses Dharma.

164
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
They all became enlightened

165
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
and had great Bodhi resolve.

166
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
After a while,

167
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Mara came back to take these goddesses back.

168
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Because the goddesses are now Bodhisattvas.

169
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
They don't want to go back to the palace of the Mara.

170
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
But Mara insists on taking them back.

171
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So Vimala Kirti said,

172
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Don't worry.

173
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You can go back to where you came from.

174
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Because I'm going to teach you

175
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
the doorway of inexhaustible lamp.

176
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Go back to this place of the Mara.

177
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You are now a lamp.

178
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
One lamp can light up hundreds and thousands of lamps

179
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
without itself being diminished.

180
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You will be like a Bodhisattva.

181
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
One lighting up the others.

182
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
The realm of Mara will be lit up.

183
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
They will all have Bodhi resolve.

184
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And reach enlightenment.

185
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So go back without being afraid.

186
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
The goddesses heard of this Dharma

187
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
and went back with Mara.

188
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So there is no difference between good and evil.

189
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's all in your heart.

190
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Even if you are in a very corrupted environment,

191
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
you can still teach them Dharma

192
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
and change them into Bodhisattvas.

193
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
The duality between good and evil

194
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
should be let go.

195
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Be an inexhaustible lamp.

196
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Now let's talk about the difference

197
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
between self and others.

198
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
In the fifth chapter,

199
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Bodhisattva Manjushri

200
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
paid a visit to Vimalakirti.

201
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
He said,

202
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
How come you are sick?

203
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
He said,

204
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
My sickness comes from the sickness

205
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
of all living beings.

206
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Because living beings are sick,

207
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
that's why I am sick.

208
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
There is no difference to him

209
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
between self and others.

210
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
All other sentient beings,

211
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
they are like his only child.

212
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Only if this child is cured,

213
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
then he will be cured.

214
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And he talks about how we are sick.

215
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
We are all sick

216
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
because we think this body,

217
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
this self,

218
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
is permanent and is me.

219
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
We have a strong ego

220
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
thinking this is the self.

221
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Vimalakirti is using his sickness

222
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
to teach us that we are all sick,

223
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
thinking there is a real me,

224
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
a real self.

225
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
That's why we are all selfish.

226
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Out of his great compassion,

227
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
he is trying to show us

228
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
how sick we are.

229
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So the whole society is sick,

230
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
the entire world is sick,

231
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
because our mind is not in the right place.

232
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
We are not back to this non-duality,

233
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
the substance of our mind.

234
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
This true nature,

235
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
now let's talk about

236
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
the duality between large and small.

237
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
We think large and small is an opposition,

238
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
but to a Bodhisattva,

239
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
there is actually no opposition.

240
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
In the sixth chapter,

241
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
with Bodhisattva Manjushri,

242
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
everybody came with him

243
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
to visit Vimalakirti.

244
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So the empty room had to fit

245
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
hundreds and thousands of people.

246
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Sir Puca thought,

247
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
oh, how can we have no place to sit?

248
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Vimalakirti, he did a miraculous feat

249
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
by transforming 32,000 chairs

250
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
into his little room.

251
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
How did these 32,000 chairs

252
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
fit in his little room?

253
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Because there is no difference

254
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
between large and small

255
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
in terms of the mind,

256
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
in terms of the essence.

257
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
The difference between

258
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
large and small is only concept.

259
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
But mundane,

260
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
we don't know the difference.

261
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
That's why to us,

262
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
they are in opposition.

263
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
The largest mountain in Buddhism

264
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
is Mount Sumeru.

265
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Mount Sumeru can fit into a mustard seed

266
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
without having to enlarge the mustard seed

267
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
or shrink the mountain.

268
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Why?

269
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Because to a Bodhisattva,

270
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
there is no difference between

271
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
large and small.

272
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
For example,

273
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
your mind is so small in this little skull,

274
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
but all the books you have studied

275
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
your entire life,

276
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
it's where?

277
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's here.

278
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
The book doesn't fit in here,

279
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
but it's all in your brain.

280
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
So in terms of the mind,

281
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
the substance,

282
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
the inner truth,

283
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
there is no duality.

284
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
There is no opposition of any kind.

285
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Lastly, in chapter nine,

286
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
it actually talks directly

287
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
about the Dharma door of non-duality.

288
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
33 Bodhisattvas,

289
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
they talk about what is duality,

290
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
such as what is pure,

291
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
impure,

292
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
transcendental,

293
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
mundane,

294
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
attention,

295
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
distraction,

296
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
good,

297
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
and evil.

298
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
They talk about all these.

299
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
At the end,

300
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Bodhisattva Manjushri

301
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
asked Vimalakirti,

302
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
how do we enter

303
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
the principle of non-duality?

304
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Vimalakirti,

305
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
he kept his silence.

306
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
He did not speak a word.

307
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Bodhisattva Manjushri said,

308
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
wonderful, wonderful.

309
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
That is the way

310
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
to enter non-duality.

311
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Because non-duality

312
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
is without syllables,

313
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
without words,

314
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
without concepts.

315
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
In this substance,

316
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
in this ultimate truth,

317
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
in our pure mind,

318
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
there is no concepts,

319
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
no words,

320
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
no language

321
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
that need to be said.

322
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
That is true non-duality.

323
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
In conclusion,

324
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
what we need to do

325
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
is be like a Buddha

326
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
who is an expert

327
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
in the deep analysis of things,

328
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
yet dwells

329
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
in the ultimate meaning.

330
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
This summarizes

331
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
these two truths.

332
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
We need to live

333
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
in this conventional world,

334
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
still be an expert

335
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
in analyzing

336
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
all the differences.

337
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
There is still difference

338
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
because we live in this world

339
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
between pure and impure,

340
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
between transcendental and mundane.

341
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It's just that

342
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
you dwell in this ultimate meaning,

343
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
which is the substance,

344
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
without any visible forms.

345
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Be away from duality inside,

346
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
but you still live

347
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
this conventional life,

348
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
which means you are not attached

349
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
to anyone or anything

350
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
because all the forms,

351
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
all the duality you see

352
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
are only illusory.

353
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It's like things happening in a dream.

354
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
They're only concepts of the mind.

355
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
That is what we call

356
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
true enlightenment.

357
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
This is the highest dharma,

358
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
the principle of non-duality.

359
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Doesn't matter if you're a layman

360
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
or you're a monk

361
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
or you live in a pure world right now

362
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
or a very corrupted world,

363
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
nothing really matters.

364
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
What matters is where you reside,

365
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
where you dwell in this heart

366
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
that is without any opposition,

367
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
no judgment.

368
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
We call it the true suchness.

369
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
So that's the class for today.

370
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Thank you for listening.

371
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Amitabha.
