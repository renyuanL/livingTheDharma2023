1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,640
Today we are going to talk about Eight Schools of Buddhism.

2
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,780
We are going to incorporate the Eight Schools of Buddhism with the Tiantai's teaching of

3
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,680
the Three-Fold Contemplation.

4
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:32,840
The first one we are going to talk about is the Tiantai School founded by Master Zhi Yi.

5
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:39,360
Tiantai Buddhism is based on the Lotus Sutra which talks about the single vehicle that

6
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,660
everyone is supposed to be a Buddha and everyone has a Buddha nature to begin with.

7
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:54,560
We have to find our true nature by the Three-Fold Meditation, the Void Meditation, Unreal Meditation

8
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,440
and Ming Meditation.

9
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:04,440
Void Meditation is to see that all dharmas arise from condition therefore it doesn't have

10
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,580
any intrinsic nature in itself.

11
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:15,380
So let go of all your attachment to everything because they are void of a true essence.

12
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:21,960
So first you understand Void Meditation, understand emptiness, then you have to understand we

13
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,600
still have Unreal Existence.

14
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,100
Everything is empty but we still have to live this life.

15
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:35,840
We still have to be a Bodhisattva and live the best we can to help all sentient beings.

16
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:43,700
If you can balance the Void and the Unreal Meditation, the Ultimate Truth and the Conventional

17
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,160
Truth, then that is the Middle Way, the Ming.

18
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,000
This is your true nature.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,600
Now let's look at the Prajna School of Buddhism.

20
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,600
Bodhisattva Nagarjuna.

21
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,600
Bodhisattva Nagarjuna.

22
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:02,520
He is the founder of Prajna, which is the School of Emptiness of Mahayana Buddhism.

23
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:10,040
He has this famous line, For dharmas arising from conditions, I affirm that they are empty.

24
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:15,180
They are conventional but yet indicate the meaning of the Middle Way.

25
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:22,760
The Three-Fold Meditation are actually derived from this verse, All dharmas arise from condition

26
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,100
because it's from cause and effect.

27
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:32,820
It's rising and ceasing, it's always changing, therefore all conditions arising, they must

28
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,820
be empty.

29
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,640
They are made up of different conditions, different factors.

30
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,620
Of course they are changing, of course they don't have a permanent self, of course there's

31
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:47,100
not a real me in any of these conditions arising.

32
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:52,020
That's the Void Meditation, but they do have conventional existence.

33
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,020
Bodhisattva Nagarjuna.

34
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,020
Bodhisattva Nagarjuna.

35
00:02:54,020 --> 00:03:00,580
We still have a life to live in this physical appearance, that's the Unreal Meditation.

36
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:07,360
You just have to live the life the best you can without being attached to anyone or anything.

37
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,580
Everything is Unreal, you are living a dream life.

38
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:17,640
But make it the best dream that you can to help all sentient beings and bring out your

39
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,640
great compassion.

40
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,740
Then it will be the Middle Way.

41
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,740
We are not dwelling on the Middle Way.

42
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,740
We are not dwelling on the Middle Way.

43
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,740
We are not dwelling on the Middle Way.

44
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,880
We are not dwelling on emptiness or existence.

45
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:30,600
We are reaching the Middle Way, our true pure mind.

46
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:36,940
Number three is the Yogacara, which means consciousness only school of Buddhism.

47
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:42,400
Of course this is also about the mind, the threefold contemplation.

48
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,740
We talk about everything in terms of the three natures.

49
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,720
One is the fully conceptualized nature.

50
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,060
This is our discrimination.

51
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,980
Our conceptual mind is actually empty.

52
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,800
We don't have this discriminating mind.

53
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:04,700
Other dependent nature, that's all the conventional existence of our life right now.

54
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:10,540
We still have to live this life that is dependent on all conditions.

55
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:15,820
Our body, family, work, society, they still exist.

56
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:20,940
You have to be a bodhisattva, appreciate, love everyone.

57
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,940
But not attached to anyone.

58
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,940
Or anything.

59
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:30,080
If you are detached from this world, be a bodhisattva, then you will reach the fully

60
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,180
accomplished nature, which is your true suchness, the mean.

61
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,700
It's all just your own mind.

62
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:42,460
So everything is based on this threefold meditation.

63
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:49,080
Number four is the Huayen school of Buddhism, based on the flower adornment sutra, or we

64
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,860
call it the Aventasaka school of Buddhism.

65
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,860
This is the threefold meditation.

66
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:57,360
This is about the world of the Buddha, the ten dharma rounds.

67
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,700
It's all created by our own mind.

68
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,480
Because the Buddha's mind is perfect, that's why they live in the perfect world.

69
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,480
That's the world of Huayen.

70
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:15,360
It's also talking about this mind being void, unreal, and mean, but it has its own names

71
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,020
in this Huayen school of Buddhism.

72
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,860
The void meditation is called contemplation.

73
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:26,420
It's contemplation that the emptiness is devoid of any attributes.

74
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,420
Because everything is empty, it doesn't have any real attributes.

75
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,860
Nothing has an intrinsic nature in itself.

76
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:40,920
Everything you see, including this body, your thoughts, they have no real essence.

77
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,000
Why attach to your opinion?

78
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,620
Why attach to everything that you think is yours?

79
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,860
Nothing is yours because the concept of the self is empty.

80
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,860
I'm not going to talk about the concept of the self.

81
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,860
I'm not going to talk about the concept of the self.

82
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,860
I'm not going to talk about the concept of the self.

83
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:56,360
But I understand the Vibe Meditation is the basis of being enlightened.

84
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:05,440
The Unreal Meditation is called the Contemplation that phenomenon and noumenon are unobstructed.

85
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,540
Phenomenon is everything that's existing.

86
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,320
The conventional truth.

87
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,340
The Noumenon is the emptiness.

88
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:16,800
The absolute truth, but they are integrated as one.

89
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,380
For a Bodhisattva.

90
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,480
A Bodhisattva lives in muha, which means emptiness.

91
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:20,600
A creation of EBputim.

92
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:20,700
It means taking one rice clean is a hiện living world.

93
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:20,800
A bread.

94
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:20,840
So to speak, it means taking one rice clean.

95
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:20,860
That means taking one rice clean.

96
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:28,980
live in this world of phenomena but they understand emptiness. That's why there is no obstruction.

97
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:34,680
That means there is no interference. You can live in this world, be a bodhisattva, have

98
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,700
a great wonderful life without being deluded, without having defilements. It's just you

99
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:47,100
have to believe in it so there's no hindrance of living out your true Buddha nature. The

100
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:54,860
Ming meditation is called contemplation about universal integration. At the end, the whole

101
00:06:54,860 --> 00:07:03,160
universe is your mind. You are in me, I am in you. That's the Buddha mind. Everyone

102
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:11,600
is connected with you, even a mosquito. Anybody and anything, they are all interconnected

103
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,700
universally in this one mind. That is the Ming meditation.

104
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:23,760
The first four schools of Buddhism is based on the teaching of Buddhism. The last four

105
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:30,920
is based on the actual practice. Number five, the Naya, which means holding precepts. Some

106
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:38,340
people, they focus their whole life on holding precepts, the moral regulations Buddha set

107
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:46,860
for us. It has three pure precepts. Basically, to do no evil, to do good, to do good, to

108
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:54,800
save all beings. A bodhisattva, they hold these three precepts. That's all they think

109
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:02,920
about every day. So the void meditation, understanding emptiness, that's how you do good deeds. You

110
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:09,820
do good deeds without having a self. Not what I can get in return, that's real goodness.

111
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:16,520
To save all sentient beings, the unreal meditation is a bodhisattva. Like a doctor, a doctor,

112
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:24,280
dispersing medicine according to the illness. Everybody needs different medicine. A bodhisattva

113
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:31,620
sees what everybody needs and they act accordingly. That's how you can really save sentient beings,

114
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:38,820
not be confused in this reincarnation anymore and reach enlightenment. The Ming meditation

115
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:46,180
is to do no evil. When you do not kill, you do not steal, you do not have sexual misconduct,

116
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:53,240
you do not do anything bad, you are already the Buddha. Number six, Zen Buddhism, or we

117
00:08:53,240 --> 00:09:01,300
call it Chen Buddhism. They focus on meditation to find this mind. When the sixth patriarch

118
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:09,120
of Zen Buddhism, Hui Nan, he became enlightened. He said five verses. Three verses, I put it

119
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:16,280
here according to the three-fold meditation. The self nature is originally pure, but the

120
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:22,280
self nature is not pure. He realized, oh, this true nature of ours is originally pure.

121
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:28,980
There's not any defilement, afflictions, or delusions. So we don't have any greed, anger,

122
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:35,740
or ignorance. It's not in our nature in the first place. So that's the void meditation,

123
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:43,100
seeing the emptiness of our afflictions. Self nature is originally complete. That's the

124
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,100
unreal meditation. Even though everything is pure, it's not pure. The self nature is

125
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:51,160
already complete. Everything is unreal. You are still endowed with limitless, meritorious

126
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:57,840
qualities, great compassion, great wisdom that's already complete inside of you. So

127
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,780
do not say you cannot be a bodhisattva in your everyday life. You just have to believe

128
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:11,580
in yourself. Self nature can generate myriad dharma. Everything is created by our mind.

129
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:16,100
You can manifest anything by putting your thought into it.

130
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:22,780
Our mind is the power of the universe. Believe in your mind, that can create everything.

131
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:28,420
So do not have bad thoughts. Your bad thoughts will come into reality. It all depends on

132
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,420
your thoughts.

133
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:36,380
Seven is the Pure Land School of Buddhism. That's what we are practicing. We are reciting

134
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:43,580
Amitabha Buddha's name and hoping to go to his Western Pure Land. That's our life goal.

135
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,040
In the Contemplation Sutra, it says,

136
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:52,780
If you want to go to the Western Pure Land with the highest grade of lotus flower, you

137
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,000
must have these three minds.

138
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:03,980
The Void Meditation is the mind of deep faith. You know your mind, the true essence, is emptiness.

139
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:10,060
That's your true nature. You have no doubt about it. You deeply reside in this truth.

140
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,380
You have deep faith.

141
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,380
The Unreal Meditation is the mind aspiring rebirth to the true nature. You have no doubt

142
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,380
about it. You deeply reside in this truth. You have deep faith.

143
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:29,900
The

144
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:41,780
Pure Land Buddhism is out of great compassion.

145
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,460
It's pure liquid.

146
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,380
It is not lead, Holy earlier,ô

147
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:50,660
and treating everyone equally hoping they will get our reincarnation and

148
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:57,620
reach enlightenment the mean meditation is the most sincere mind your mind is

149
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:03,260
the Buddha it doesn't have any wandering thoughts that is called sincere mind not

150
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:09,800
a single selfish thought not a single deluded thought if you have these three

151
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:15,320
minds you'll definitely go to the Western Pure land eight is the esoteric

152
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:21,620
this school of Buddhism holds a lot of special mantras and believes that one

153
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:26,920
can reach Buddhahood in this very lifetime it's also talking about our

154
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:34,020
true nature in terms of the three bodies of Buddha all Buddha and all sentient

155
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:39,220
beings have three bodies dharmakaya manifestation body

156
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:39,720
Atma원

157
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:46,720
the incarnation body. Void meditation is our manifestation body, which is talking

158
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,140
about our form. When you have void meditation, you can get rid of your

159
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:58,540
defilements. That's when your appearance will be like a bodhisattva. We can have

160
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:04,220
the incarnation body, the function of our mind. Like Shakyamuni Buddha, he was a

161
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:09,600
real prince in India. He had a wife, he had children, he did all these things

162
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,440
like a normal person. That is incarnation body. He was really existing in this

163
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:21,320
unreal conventional world. Lastly it's the Dharmakaya. it's our essence body

164
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:26,880
which is the middleway which is the mean which is this perfect self that

165
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:32,980
everybody have Everyone has these three Dharma bodies just like all buddhas.

166
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,740
It's just we haven't recognized it. So these are eight schools of Mahayana

167
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,280
Buddhism.

168
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:44,880
They're all talking about this one mind in terms of the three-fold meditation.

169
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,960
Which school of Buddhism you practice, it doesn't matter.

170
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,460
The ultimate goal is to find your true nature.

171
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,340
Live this life like a bodhisattva.

172
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,000
Detach from everything.

173
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,520
Live the life to the fullest and help everyone you can.

174
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,960
Then you're living out your true essence, your true Buddha nature.

175
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,360
Hope this helps.

176
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,640
