1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,800
Today we are going to talk about unwholesome mental factors.

2
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,700
This is from the One Hundred Dharma Structure by Bodhisattva Vasavandhu.

3
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,600
It talks about everything in terms of One Hundred Dharma.

4
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:34,100
Out of the One Hundred Dharma, fifty-one are mental factors.

5
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:40,800
Out of the fifty-one, there are twenty-six that are considered unwholesome mental factors.

6
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,600
So these are our afflictions.

7
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,100
In this class, we will talk about these twenty-six unwholesome mental factors.

8
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,900
Hopefully it will help us eradicate our afflictions.

9
00:00:51,900 --> 00:01:01,600
The twenty-six consists of six primary unwholesome mental factors and twenty secondary unwholesome mental factors.

10
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,800
Out of the twenty, it's divided up into ten minor, two medium, and eight major.

11
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,500
Let's first look at the six primary unwholesome mental factors.

12
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,700
Number one is greed.

13
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,200
Because we have a strong self, we are selfish.

14
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,500
That's why we are often greedy.

15
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,500
And that is the reason why we are in this reincarnation.

16
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,900
In the Sutra of Eight Realizations of Great Beings, it says,

17
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,100
Excessive desire is suffering.

18
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:41,100
Birth, death, and weariness in life originate from greed and desire.

19
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:47,200
All our life and death and reincarnation comes from our greed.

20
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,900
We should let go of our greed and our selfishness.

21
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,500
Two people were riding on the ship.

22
00:01:53,500 --> 00:02:00,100
A gave B all his luggages, trusting his friend who would take care of his luggages.

23
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:08,100
B thought, oh, I should put all my friend's luggage on the bottom, and I put my luggage on top of his.

24
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,100
That way, if the ship gets wet, mine will not get wet.

25
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,900
But there was a big storm.

26
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:20,700
So the captain ordered the crew member to throw excessive luggages into the ocean.

27
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,700
Four-way reduction.

28
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,700
All B's luggages were thrown out of the ship.

29
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,500
A's luggages were still okay.

30
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,300
So do not be selfish.

31
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:36,900
When you do things that are unwholesome for your own benefit, the karma will just come right back to you.

32
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,400
Number two is anger.

33
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,700
We are often angry for many different unpleasant situations.

34
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:50,500
We can be mad at our body because of birth, aging, sickness, death.

35
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,700
We can be mad at ourselves when we have greed, anger, ignorance.

36
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,700
And we can be mad about the environment when it's hot, it's cold.

37
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,100
We think it's unpleasant, and we become upset.

38
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:11,300
And we can be angry about people that hurt us, our competitors, even friends and families.

39
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:17,100
And we can be angry about death at the end because we don't want it to happen.

40
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,700
Moreover, we are angry about ourselves.

41
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,500
About others, about the past, present, and future.

42
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,700
We can be upset about everything.

43
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:34,900
That's why we have to really look at how much anger we have inside of us.

44
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,500
There were two people on a boat arguing.

45
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,500
Why did you say that to me yesterday?

46
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,100
You tell me exactly why.

47
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,900
Little did they know, the time they spent arguing, the boat is already sinking.

48
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,100
The sinking boat is symbolizing reincarnation.

49
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:50,600
We are...

50
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,700
We are in the sinking boat.

51
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:57,000
But we are still quibbling, arguing, and mad at each other.

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,200
That's really being silly.

53
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,500
So do not be angry about anything or anyone.

54
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,300
Number three is ignorance.

55
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:11,700
Because we think there's a real me, we do everything dependent on the self.

56
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,900
That's the biggest ignorance.

57
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,400
And we do not believe in karma.

58
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,800
Doing wholesome deeds will bring good retribution.

59
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,100
And

60
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,800
unwholesome deeds will give you unwholesome retribution.

61
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:30,000
When we do not believe in karma, we will likely be worried and fearful about everything.

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,300
Because we don't understand karma.

63
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,100
That's all ignorance.

64
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,100
Number four is arrogance.

65
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,800
Everybody is arrogant in some ways.

66
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,000
Some are arrogant because of their education, their wealth, or their looks.

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You might look down upon others.

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,800
That's all.

69
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,800
Because of our arrogance.

70
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,300
Number five is doubt.

71
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,300
We have a lot of doubt about our self.

72
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,100
Doubting our ability to become a Buddha.

73
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,200
We're doubting the teacher.

74
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,900
We don't think the teacher has the right cultivation.

75
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,400
So we don't believe in the teaching.

76
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,200
And we doubt the Dharma.

77
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,900
We don't think the Dharma can really be applied in real life.

78
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,200
If we have doubt, we are constantly unsure about what to do.

79
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,900
And always confused.

80
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,800
Number six is our wrong views.

81
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:31,000
Biggest wrong view is believing this body is the real me and separate from everyone else.

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,200
That's why we have a lot of opposition with everyone else in this world.

83
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:43,200
Following the primary unwholesome thoughts comes 20 unwholesome mental factors.

84
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,400
Let's first look at the 10 minor ones.

85
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,300
Number one is hatred.

86
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:54,500
When unpleasant event happens, hatred can arise because of someone's words.

87
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,500
Because of the situation, we can explode.

88
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,000
That's at the moment.

89
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Number two is vengeance.

90
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
After the things happen, we hold grudges.

91
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,700
We might not show our hatred right there.

92
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,200
We repress it and we keep it inside of our heart.

93
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,700
Number three is vexation.

94
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:17,200
Because we have vengeance, we are likely to develop vexation.

95
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,100
That's when you get angry.

96
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,700
That's when you really want to get back to others.

97
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,300
We want to sue others.

98
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,300
Take revenge or talk back.

99
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,500
That's all because we have strong vexation.

100
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,800
All these are because of anger.

101
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,800
Number four is concealment.

102
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,100
When we do something wrong, we are likely to cover it up.

103
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,400
Because we want to have a good image of ourselves.

104
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:47,200
That's why we conceal our mistakes or our bad habits and bad behavior.

105
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:52,600
But when we conceal our bad deeds, negative karma will grow bigger.

106
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,200
Number five is deceiving.

107
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,700
We might be falsely kind.

108
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:03,000
We're lying, we're pretending, trying to deceive others to get some benefit.

109
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,700
That's all because we are not being sincere.

110
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,300
Number six is flattering.

111
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:15,600
We might flatter our boss, our superior, our parents because we want to gain some benefits.

112
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,800
That's all being insincere.

113
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,900
That is not a cultivator.

114
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,900
Number seven is pride.

115
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,100
Pride is being proud of ourselves.

116
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:30,200
It's kind of like arrogance, but you have to compare with others to be arrogant.

117
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:36,400
Pride, even without comparison, you're just naturally proud of yourself, thinking you're better.

118
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,500
Even when you're poor, you can still be proud.

119
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,800
Even if you have no education, you can still think I'm very smart.

120
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,900
That's all because of our natural pride.

121
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,100
Number eight is harmfulness.

122
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:54,400
When we have a vaccination, we might want to cause harm to others.

123
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,900
We want to kill, we want to do all these things that are very violent.

124
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,700
Number nine is jealousy.

125
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,700
Jealousy is also anger.

126
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:12,300
We do not want to see others being successful because we think we should be the only one that should be successful.

127
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,700
That's because of our selfishness.

128
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,600
Number ten is parsimony.

129
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
Number ten is parsimony.

130
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:24,200
When we are stingy, we don't want to share our wealth or the dharma because we don't want others to have it.

131
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:29,000
All these are very strong vaccinations and afflictions.

132
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:37,400
Hatred, vengeance, vexation, harmfulness, and jealousy, they are based off of anger.

133
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:42,800
Concealment, deceiving, flattering are based on ignorance.

134
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,400
Pride and parsimony.

135
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,600
They are based on our greed.

136
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,400
Now let's look at the two median unwholesome mental factors.

137
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,900
One is shamelessness.

138
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,600
Two is guiltlessness.

139
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:03,700
Shamelessness is when we do not want to hear about wholesome virtues and cultivation of good people.

140
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,400
We actually dislike it.

141
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:12,900
Guiltlessness is when we like all the wrongdoings, all the violence, or people suing each other.

142
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,400
We're actually happy.

143
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,200
That's because we don't like it.

144
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,700
That's because we are guiltless.

145
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:21,700
When we are shameless and guiltless, we will do any kind of bad deeds.

146
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:26,100
So all bad deeds come from these two mental factors.

147
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,000
Now let's look at the eight unwholesome mental factors.

148
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,100
These are all things that are hindering our meditation.

149
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,600
Number one is drowsiness.

150
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,300
When we meditate, we become sleepy and drowsy.

151
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,600
When you cannot focus, the meditation will have no result.

152
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,400
Number two is restlessness.

153
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,700
It's the opposite of drowsiness.

154
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:54,600
When we have a lot of things going on in our mind, we're actually excited.

155
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,300
It's having a lot of wandering thoughts.

156
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,800
It cannot keep still.

157
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,200
It's agitated.

158
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,400
Number three is faithlessness.

159
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:09,600
When we do not believe in cultivating, in changing our afflictions, and becoming wholesome,

160
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,600
we do not believe we can reach Buddhahood.

161
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,900
And we do not believe we can achieve Buddhahood.

162
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,200
And change our bad habits.

163
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:21,200
When you do not believe, you cannot succeed in any of your cultivation.

164
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,500
Number four is slothfulness.

165
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,200
Being lazy in our cultivation.

166
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,900
We do not want to meditate.

167
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,300
We do not want to prostrate to Buddha.

168
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:34,000
We do not want to chant because we are simply lazy.

169
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,700
Number five is heedlessness.

170
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:40,900
It's kind of like laziness, but it's more not following the rule.

171
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,500
We're not watching our mind, our thoughts, our words.

172
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,300
We are just letting ourselves go wild.

173
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,400
Six is forgetfulness.

174
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,200
We forget to be mindful.

175
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,500
To be mindful of our Buddha nature.

176
00:10:54,500 --> 00:11:00,600
We let our thoughts go wild and just follow whatever the situation is going on right now.

177
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,600
Seven is distraction.

178
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,400
Distracted by a lot of wandering thoughts.

179
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,400
Our mind is chaotic and agitated.

180
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:13,200
It's kind of like the restlessness, but it's more distracting.

181
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,200
Eight is unmindfulness.

182
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,700
Kind of like wrong view.

183
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,200
We are unmindful because we don't have the right view.

184
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,300
We might think our own opinion is right.

185
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:28,200
We do not follow the good teachings and we believe in our own opinions.

186
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:33,500
All these are mental factors that are hindering our meditation.

187
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:41,800
As you can see, the kinds of afflictions are different in the primary, secondary, the minor,

188
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,800
median, and major.

189
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,300
Now,

190
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,700
let's look at them in terms of the eight consciousnesses.

191
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:55,600
The eight consciousnesses, they all have a different number of unwholesome mental factors.

192
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,900
The eighth one is our laya consciousness, the big storehouse that stores all our karmic seeds.

193
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:07,400
The seventh consciousness is our manas, which is attached to the eight consciousnesses,

194
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,500
thinking there is a real me and a real self.

195
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,100
It's called the manas.

196
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,500
Then the seventh consciousness,

197
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,000
tells the sixth consciousness,

198
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,900
our mind,

199
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,900
what to think,

200
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:22,800
how to think about situations that we experience in our life.

201
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,700
Then we have the first five consciousnesses,

202
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,500
eyes,

203
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,200
ears,

204
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:27,900
nose,

205
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,600
tongue,

206
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,100
body consciousness.

207
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,200
So these five,

208
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,000
they work outside and the sixth consciousness is their manager.

209
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,700
These are the eight consciousnesses of how our mind functions.

210
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,900
So the eight consciousnesses,

211
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:47,700
all have different kinds of unwholesome mental factors.

212
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,000
The first five consciousnesses,

213
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,800
they only have greed,

214
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,500
anger,

215
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,600
and ignorance.

216
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,200
I have a five here.

217
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,100
Out of the six primary,

218
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,900
they are only capable of greed,

219
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,600
anger,

220
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,900
and ignorance.

221
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:07,200
They don't have any of the minor unwholesome mental factors.

222
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,500
They have the two medium ones,

223
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,100
and they have the eight major ones.

224
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,900
So three plus two plus eight,

225
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,700
together,

226
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,800
it has 13 out of the 26.

227
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,300
The sixth consciousness,

228
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,800
because the mind is very powerful,

229
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,100
it can think a lot,

230
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:30,000
it's capable of all 26 unwholesome mental factors.

231
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,600
So the one that really creates karma is really our mind consciousness.

232
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,300
The seventh consciousness,

233
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:41,500
it has four out of the six primary unwholesome,

234
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,900
mental factors.

235
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,000
It has greed,

236
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,800
greedy about the self.

237
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,000
It has no anger,

238
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,200
because it's never angry about the self.

239
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,600
It has ignorance,

240
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,200
thinking there's a self,

241
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,700
and it's arrogant about the self.

242
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,300
It has no doubt.

243
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,600
It has wrong view,

244
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,500
wrong view about the self.

245
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,400
Because it's only caring about the self,

246
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,400
it only has four out of the six.

247
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,700
It has no minor unwholesome mental factors,

248
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,300
and it has no medium ones.

249
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,300
It only has the major ones,

250
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,700
four plus eight together for a total of 12.

251
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,600
The eighth,

252
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,900
the liar consciousness,

253
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,600
it doesn't create karma,

254
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,400
so it's not wholesome or unwholesome.

255
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,400
It's a big storehouse,

256
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,400
stores everything as karmic seeds.

257
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,700
As you can see,

258
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,100
the minor,

259
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,200
medium,

260
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,200
major,

261
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,600
secondary unwholesome mental factors,

262
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,500
these are not based on the severity,

263
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,800
of the affliction.

264
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,300
They are based on the range of function

265
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,000
in the eight consciousnesses.

266
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,300
The minor one is called minor,

267
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,900
because it's only working in the sixth consciousness.

268
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,500
The medium one is called medium,

269
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,400
because it's in the first five consciousnesses,

270
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,300
and the sixth consciousnesses.

271
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,700
And the major one is called major,

272
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,200
because it's in the first five,

273
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,800
and the sixth consciousnesses,

274
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,500
and the seventh consciousnesses.

275
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,200
Therefore,

276
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,900
the range is bigger,

277
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,000
that's why it's called major.

278
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,200
If we can understand these 26 unwholesome mental factors,

279
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,100
always be mindful of our thoughts,

280
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,400
and be able to catch them early,

281
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:32,200
we are able to purify our consciousnesses,

282
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:37,200
and transform the deluded consciousnesses into wisdom.

283
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,000
That's how we change from a mundane

284
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,800
to

285
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,000
a Buddha.

286
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,800
Everyone can do this.

287
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,600
Why?

288
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:49,000
Because the eighth consciousness is actually our Buddha nature.

289
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,200
Just wake up and purify it.

290
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,500
All the unwholesome mental factors,

291
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,600
they do not really exist.

292
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,200
It's not in us to have these unwholesome mental factors.

293
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,800
You really have to believe that you are wholesome,

294
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,000
you are good,

295
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,800
you have the Buddha nature.

296
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,500
So by understanding how these

297
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,800
unwholesome mental factors work,

298
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,100
we can truly make a change in our lives right now,

299
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,000
and be out of reincarnation,

300
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,400
and reach Buddhahood.

301
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:26,000
It's all from being able to eradicate our unwholesome mental factors.

302
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,500
So that's the class for today.

303
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,900
Thank you for listening.

304
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,000
Amitabha.
