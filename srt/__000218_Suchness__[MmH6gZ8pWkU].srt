1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,880
Today we are going to talk about Suchness.

2
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:27,000
Suchness means the reality of things, which means our true Buddha nature, our true mind, our true essence.

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,800
We all have the Buddha nature, but why can't we live like a Buddha?

4
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:40,000
Today we are going to awaken our faith in the Mahayana teaching of our own Suchness.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Suchness itself, it cannot really be described with words,

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
because words are provincial and are incapable of denoting the Suchness.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,800
But if we try to explain Suchness with words,

8
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,800
it will have two aspects.

9
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,800
The first is the aspect of truly empty,

10
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,800
and the second is the aspect of truly non-empty.

11
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,800
Let's first talk about truly empty.

12
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:14,800
It has never been related to any defiled state of existence.

13
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:21,800
Suchness is not corresponding to any defiled existence of our mind.

14
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,800
So it's not related, it's not corresponding,

15
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:31,800
with our agitated mind that's full of greed, anger, and ignorance.

16
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,800
That's not our true nature.

17
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,800
That's not our true self.

18
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,800
For example, just like magnets.

19
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,800
Magnets only attract things that have magnetic fields,

20
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,800
such as iron or a needle.

21
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,800
But it doesn't attract anything, fabric or plastic,

22
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,800
because it's not of the same magnetic field.

23
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,800
So our true mind is not attracted to any deluded state of mind.

24
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,800
It's always at peace, and it's pure and clear.

25
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,800
We can explain it with two parts.

26
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,800
Suchness is free from all marks of individual distinction of things.

27
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,800
First, it's free from all marks.

28
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,800
That means all forms, all kinds of judgments,

29
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
or the world of objects.

30
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
For example, if I ask you,

31
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
Who are you?

32
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,800
You might say your name, your gender, your profession.

33
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,800
That's what we think make up who we are.

34
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,800
But that's just still individual distinction of things.

35
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,800
True suchness is away from all the world of objects.

36
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,800
Second, suchness has nothing to do with thoughts

37
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,800
conceived by the deluded mind.

38
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,800
The conscious thinker itself,

39
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,800
the conscious mind itself,

40
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,800
is actually empty in nature.

41
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,800
The perceiving subject and the world of objects

42
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,800
both are empty and unreal.

43
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,800
It's not who we truly are.

44
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
It's not our suchness.

45
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,800
It's not our reality of things.

46
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,800
There was a monk from Korea in the Tang Dynasty.

47
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,800
His name is Wang You.

48
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,800
His friend wanted to travel to China

49
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,800
to further their study in Buddhism.

50
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,800
One night, they decided to stay in a cave.

51
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,800
Wang You was very thirsty,

52
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,800
so he looked for water.

53
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,800
Finally, he heard the sound of water,

54
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,800
and he started drinking the water.

55
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,800
And he thought, oh, how great and refreshing.

56
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,800
And in the morning when he woke up,

57
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,800
he realized the water he was drinking

58
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,800
was actually rotten water from human skull.

59
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,800
He wanted to throw up.

60
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,800
But at that moment,

61
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,800
he came to great enlightenment.

62
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:55,800
He realized everything is created by our deluded mind.

63
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,800
That's why we have all these experiences of things.

64
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,800
It's all created from our own mind.

65
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,800
And it's empty.

66
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,800
It's not real.

67
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,800
So that's the first aspect of suchness.

68
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,800
The second aspect is truly not empty.

69
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,800
Because it's empty,

70
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,800
it's naturally endowed with all these excellent qualities

71
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,800
that we originally have.

72
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,800
You just let go of the deluded mind,

73
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,800
it will surface and come right out.

74
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,800
There are six excellent qualities that we naturally have.

75
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,800
The first is light of great wisdom.

76
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,800
We all have lights.

77
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,800
We're all shiny.

78
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,800
This light comes from our innate wisdom.

79
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,800
We have the wisdom knowing the emptiness

80
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,800
of all delusion of the ego.

81
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,800
And we have the wisdom

82
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,800
of knowing our own suchness,

83
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,800
our true existence.

84
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,800
So that wisdom will give us great light,

85
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,800
which is great strength.

86
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,800
In the Tang Dynasty,

87
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,800
there was a master named Dao Ang.

88
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,800
He was teaching at the Hanling Mountain Temple.

89
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,800
He taught till it was late at night and dark.

90
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,800
But they didn't prepare any candles.

91
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,800
So all the students,

92
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
they were complaining about the darkness.

93
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,800
Master Dao Ang,

94
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,800
raised his hand,

95
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,800
and a beam of light started shining

96
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,800
and it lit up the entire lecture hall.

97
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,800
All the students,

98
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,800
they were astonished.

99
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,800
The master said,

100
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,800
the light has always been here.

101
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,800
It's shining as usual.

102
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,800
Nothing strange at all.

103
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,800
That's like our Buddha nature.

104
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,800
It's always here.

105
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,800
It's always shining.

106
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,800
It's our usual state of existence.

107
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,800
It's not a miracle.

108
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,800
It's not fantasy.

109
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,800
It's our actual self.

110
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,800
So know and believe in your own light of great wisdom.

111
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,800
Number two,

112
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,800
illuminating the entire universe.

113
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,800
This light is illuminating and shining

114
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,800
and helping the entire world.

115
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,800
When you have the true essence,

116
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,800
you will see the entire universe as one.

117
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,800
You will have equal compassion toward all beings.

118
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,800
In the Ming Dynasty,

119
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,800
there was a master named Lam Tzu.

120
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,800
He is the eighth patriarch of the Pureland Buddhism.

121
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
He cultivated for a while.

122
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,800
He decided to reside in the mountain of Yunqi.

123
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,800
And that mountain had a big population of vicious tigers.

124
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,800
But he stayed there anyways.

125
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,800
After he stayed up in the mountain,

126
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,800
all the tigers became his disciples

127
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,800
and stopped harming people.

128
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
All the villagers,

129
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,800
they were admiring the master.

130
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,800
This place has been in drought for years.

131
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,800
The villagers decided to beg the master

132
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,800
to pray for rain.

133
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,800
So they went up to the mountain

134
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,800
and asked the mountain to perform some magic

135
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,800
so they will have rain.

136
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,800
The master said,

137
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,800
I don't have any magic.

138
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,800
All I know is chanting Amitabha Buddha's name.

139
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,800
So he led the villagers

140
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,800
to walk along the dry fields

141
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,800
and they saw a lion chanting Amitabha Buddha's name.

142
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,800
And with his footsteps and his chanting,

143
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,800
rain started falling.

144
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,800
And they were like,

145
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,800
wow, this is more amazing than magic.

146
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,800
Why is this happening?

147
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,800
It's not just because of Amitabha Buddha's power.

148
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,800
It's actually because of our own essence.

149
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,800
We all have the power to help all sentient beings

150
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,800
to pray when we are not using our dulidomite

151
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,800
and using our mind.

152
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,800
Our Buddha nature to live

153
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,800
and have great compassion

154
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,800
for all living beings.

155
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,800
So know that you are illuminating

156
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,800
the entire universe.

157
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,800
Number three is true cognition.

158
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,800
This is talking about our consciousness.

159
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,800
Our consciousness actually can see

160
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,800
three different states of existence.

161
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,800
Number one is the state of representation.

162
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,800
Number two is the state of image.

163
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,800
And number three is the state of suchness.

164
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,800
For example, when I see a person,

165
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,800
first, I see the state of representation.

166
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,800
How tall, how short, how attractive,

167
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,800
how attractive I see his appearance.

168
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,800
So that's the state of representation.

169
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,800
Second, if I close my eyes

170
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,800
and I imagine this person,

171
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,800
I see the state of imagery.

172
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,800
I will have my own judgment of this person.

173
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,800
I will keep the image of this person in my mind.

174
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,800
That's how I remember this person.

175
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,800
The third is the state of suchness.

176
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,800
That's when I see beyond the appearance

177
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,800
and beyond my own judgment of the person,

178
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,800
I see this person as Buddha.

179
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,800
I see his suchness.

180
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,800
I see his real existence.

181
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,800
Enlightened person always see everything

182
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,800
and everybody as Buddha.

183
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,800
When you're awakened,

184
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,800
you see beauty in everything and everybody.

185
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,800
So that's number three, true cognition.

186
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,800
Number four, mind is pure in itself, nature.

187
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,800
So we're back to the purity of the mind.

188
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,800
This is kind of like emptiness.

189
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,800
It's empty of all delusions.

190
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,800
Greed, anger, and ignorance

191
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,800
is not our true self,

192
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,800
our true self is clear,

193
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,800
pure, clean, and clear shining mind.

194
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,800
For example,

195
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,800
if you are chanting the Buddha's name for 20 minutes,

196
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,800
maybe for five minutes,

197
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,800
you are concentrating on chanting Amitabha Buddha's name.

198
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,800
But for the 15 minutes,

199
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,800
you are having wondering thoughts

200
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,800
about how cold, how hot,

201
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,800
what you're going to do later,

202
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
what that person said about you.

203
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,800
You have all these wondering thoughts.

204
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,800
So which one is the real you?

205
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,800
Which one is your true mind?

206
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,800
In reality,

207
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,800
the mind that is having all these wondering thoughts,

208
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
you think that's the real you,

209
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
but that's not you.

210
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,800
That's the deluded you that doesn't really exist.

211
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,800
The real you is the one

212
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,800
that's been chanting single-mindedly

213
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,800
because your true Buddha nature

214
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,800
is always in samadhi,

215
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,800
is always in deep concentration

216
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,800
without wondering thoughts.

217
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,800
Believe in your pure mind.

218
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,800
Number five,

219
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,800
the mind is eternity,

220
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,800
bliss, self-nature, and purity.

221
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,800
These are the four virtues of Nirvana

222
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,800
or four virtues of Buddha.

223
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,800
So that's the real self.

224
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,800
It's eternity because it lasts forever.

225
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,800
It does not die.

226
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,800
When this body dies,

227
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,800
the end of this life,

228
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,800
it doesn't end.

229
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,800
It lasts forever and ever.

230
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,800
It's eternity.

231
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,800
And it's bliss.

232
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,800
The person who's enlightened,

233
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,800
who's living in their suchness,

234
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,800
is always happy.

235
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,800
It's a quiet joy coming from inside.

236
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,800
It's not the happiness from outside,

237
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,800
winning a lottery or buying a new home

238
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,800
or having some kind of accomplishment.

239
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,800
It's not coming from the outside.

240
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,800
It's all from within,

241
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,800
from your own true nature.

242
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,800
You know the existence of your suchness.

243
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,800
You have this joy and happiness.

244
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,800
That's true dharma in your heart.

245
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
And the self-nature,

246
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,800
you find your true self that has no selfishness.

247
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,800
It's not the ego,

248
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,800
but the selfless self

249
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,800
that is in control of the emotion

250
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
that doesn't have any ill feeling

251
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,800
or feeling toward anyone.

252
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,800
That's your true self.

253
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,800
And then purity.

254
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,800
It's always pure without any deluded thoughts.

255
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,800
So these four are the virtues

256
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,800
that we all have to begin with.

257
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,800
The last self-nature is refreshing,

258
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,800
coolness,

259
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,800
immutability,

260
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,800
and freedom.

261
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,800
So these three are actually the summary

262
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,800
of the first five.

263
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,800
Refreshing, coolness,

264
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,800
that's talking about our prajna,

265
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,800
which means our wisdom.

266
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,800
So the light,

267
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,800
the illuminating,

268
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,800
the true cognition,

269
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,800
it all means our wisdom,

270
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,800
our great wisdom.

271
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,800
Okay, so that's prajna.

272
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,800
Immutability,

273
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,800
it's unchanging.

274
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,800
That's talking about number five.

275
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,800
It's eternity,

276
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,800
bliss,

277
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,800
self-nature,

278
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,800
and purity.

279
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,800
That's our true virtue.

280
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,800
That's never changing.

281
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,800
Forever firm and always there.

282
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,800
That's called our dharmakaya,

283
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,800
which means our true body,

284
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,800
our essence body,

285
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,800
or our spiritual body,

286
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,800
our own suchness.

287
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,800
Okay, and the last one is freedom.

288
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,800
It means number four.

289
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,800
Our mind is pure.

290
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,800
It's freedom.

291
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,800
It's deliverance,

292
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,800
deliverance of all the storms

293
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,800
that's going on in your mind

294
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,800
because they don't really exist.

295
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,800
You free yourself from this convoluted,

296
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,800
agitated,

297
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,800
and stirred up mind.

298
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,800
The greatness of our own suchness.

299
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,800
It's truly empty,

300
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,800
and it's truly not empty.

301
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,800
It's actually talking about just one thing.

302
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,800
It is what it is.

303
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,800
That's the way things should be.

304
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,800
That's our normal state of existence.

305
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
So we need to do three things.

306
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,800
First, we need to have faith.

307
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,800
We have to believe in our suchness.

308
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,800
Once you believe it,

309
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,800
you're already successful.

310
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,800
You're becoming a Buddha.

311
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,800
You need to have deep faith,

312
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,800
just like you believe money can buy things,

313
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,800
just as you believe drinking water

314
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,800
will keep you alive.

315
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,800
That's how deep you should believe

316
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,800
in the true reality of things,

317
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,800
your own suchness.

318
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,800
Second, you need to contemplate on it,

319
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,800
which means you meditate on it.

320
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,800
Think about it all day long.

321
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,800
I am light of great wisdom.

322
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,800
You can say it like a mantra in your meditation.

323
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,800
Keep saying it.

324
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,800
That's called the permeation of suchness.

325
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,800
So suchness will induce manifestation of itself

326
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,800
to grow bigger and bigger.

327
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,800
And then you have great mind power.

328
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,800
Lastly, we have to use it,

329
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,800
just like you were a beggar before.

330
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,800
Now you find this priceless jewel in your clothing.

331
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,800
You exchange it for money

332
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,800
and change your life.

333
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,800
You don't beg anymore.

334
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,800
We are not a beggar.

335
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,800
We are actually very wealthy in our spirit.

336
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,800
So use this great spirit of yours

337
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,800
and use it to live a joyous and abundant life.

338
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,800
