1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,600
Today we are going to talk about the greatest offerings.

2
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,800
As a Buddhist, we show our reverence by giving material offerings to Buddha.

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,400
But what is the true offering? It is actually the offering of the Dharma.

4
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:34,400
In the Practices and Vows of Universal Worthy Bodhisattva, it talks about seven offerings of the Dharma.

5
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,800
And that's what we'll be talking about for today.

6
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,400
Number one, the offering of cultivation in accordance with Buddha's teaching.

7
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,600
It is one thing to listen to the sutra and another thing to really practice the Dharma in our daily lives.

8
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:55,200
As Confucius said, if a man is proper in his conduct, others will perform without orders.

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,600
If a man is improper in his conduct, though giving orders, no one will obey.

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,000
So how come our kids and family will not listen to us?

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,600
It's because we're not good role models.

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,400
In ancient China, there was a grandfather who lived with his son and grandson.

13
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,600
They lived together for many years.

14
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,000
But the grandfather got old and sick, and the son wanted to get rid of the grandfather.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,400
So one day he made a large bamboo basket,

16
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,800
and he carried the grandfather up the mountain with the bamboo basket and wanted to leave him there.

17
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,600
The grandson saw the whole situation, so he cleverly said to his dad,

18
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:40,400
Hey dad, that saved the bamboo basket, so I can carry you up the mountain when you become old.

19
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:47,800
The father was very embarrassed of his behavior, immediately took the grandfather home and took very good care of him.

20
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,200
We want to be a good role model who really practice Buddha's Dharma,

21
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,200
and be all that is good, that is really honoring Buddha.

22
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,800
Number two is the offering of benefiting all sentient beings.

23
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,800
All sentient beings are Buddha's only beloved son.

24
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,800
So by benefiting all sentient beings, we're making Buddha very happy.

25
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,400
And also all sentient beings, they have the same Buddha nature as us.

26
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,600
We are all together as one.

27
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,200
So love and really care for all sentient beings.

28
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,200
In America,

29
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,200
there was a ten-year-old boy.

30
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:29,200
He was struggling in school because he had a compulsive behavior of tapping with his hands.

31
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,400
So all the teachers got very upset and sent him to the principal's office.

32
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,000
And the principal said to him,

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Clinton, why don't you try to sit on your hands whenever you felt like tapping?

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,800
But usually that will only work for five seconds.

35
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,800
And he started tapping again.

36
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,600
So one day in class, he started tapping again.

37
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,200
And his teacher, Mr. Jensen said to him,

38
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,600
Clinton, you stay after class.

39
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,200
Clinton thought this time I'm in big trouble.

40
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,800
So he was really afraid.

41
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,400
After class, Mr. Jensen sat him down and gently said to him,

42
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,400
Clinton, you're not in trouble.

43
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,600
I just want to ask you one thing.

44
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,800
Have you ever thought about playing the drums?

45
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,600
And Mr. Jensen took out a pair of drumsticks out of his drawer.

46
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:19,400
From that day on, Clinton started playing the drums and he became a world famous drummer.

47
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,200
It only takes one person who truly cares to transform a person's life.

48
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,800
So be that person.

49
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,200
Number three, the offering of embracing all sentient beings.

50
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:37,400
Buddha gave us four methods so we can gain trust and build good relationships with all sentient beings.

51
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,400
Number one is giving.

52
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,600
We want to always be giving.

53
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:47,800
For example, in the household, we always want to save the food that other people like to eat for them.

54
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,200
And we eat something else.

55
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,200
That way they will know that you really care for them.

56
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,000
Or we can give the gift of smiling.

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,400
We always smile in the house so everybody feel your loving kindness.

58
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,800
And number two is loving words.

59
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,600
We always want to give positive feedbacks.

60
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,400
Oh, you're such a great husband.

61
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,800
You're so good at cooking.

62
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,600
Oh, you're such a good cleaner.

63
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,600
We always want to be positive so the atmosphere in the house will be very good.

64
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,000
Number three is support.

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,200
Everybody goes through difficult times.

66
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,600
And needs support.

67
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,200
We want to be the person that's always there to love and encourage them.

68
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,400
Number four is teamwork.

69
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,400
Always do things together.

70
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,800
We can set a time every week so we can chant Buddha's name together.

71
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,200
We can listen to Dharma together.

72
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,000
Or we can eat vegetarian food together.

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,400
That's all good teamwork that will build up a great family and a great relationship.

74
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,600
So use these four methods to embrace all sentient beings.

75
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,000
Number four is the offering of enduring suffering on behalf of others.

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Karma is personal.

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,600
We cannot replace other people's karma and suffering.

78
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:06,200
But what we can do is try to endure as much suffering as we can so other people will suffer less.

79
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,200
There was a Buddhist story about a giant turtle.

80
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,800
A group of virgins, they were sailing when a big storm hit.

81
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,400
The giant turtle saw the shipwreck and saved the merchants by letting them climb on his back.

82
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,600
He brought them safely to land.

83
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,200
Tired from the long swim and the heavy load, he fell asleep on the sand.

84
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,600
Meanwhile, the merchants, they were hungry and thirsty.

85
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,400
And after the ordeal, they were still not sure of their lives.

86
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,800
So they were discussing amongst themselves how to find food.

87
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,000
One of them said, we should kill and eat the turtle.

88
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The turtle heard this and out of great compassion for the merchants, he decided to stay put and be eaten.

89
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
That turtle was Shakyamuni Buddha.

90
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:55,600
Buddha said, there is not an inch of land where I did not lay my life for all sentient beings.

91
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,600
So sacrifice and enduring pain for others is the Bodhisattva way.

92
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,600
Number five, the offering of diligently fostering good roots.

93
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,200
Good roots are firm foundations we accumulate by cultivation.

94
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:16,200
Usually, we say there are three good roots, no greed, no anger, and no ignorance.

95
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,200
Number one is no greed.

96
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,800
We don't want to be coveted about the things that other people are greedy for.

97
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,400
In fact, we want to be yielding, let other people have the good things.

98
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,800
Number two is no anger.

99
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,400
We have to know this life, we are just travelers passing by.

100
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,400
So don't be contentious about anything with anyone.

101
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,000
It's not worth fighting because we are going to go to the pure land.

102
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,400
We're going to become Buddha.

103
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,600
So don't fight over the little thing this lifetime.

104
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,200
It's really not worth it.

105
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,200
We're just here to cultivate and contribute.

106
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,200
Number three is no ignorance.

107
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,200
We believe in karma.

108
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,200
Know that we really don't possess anything this lifetime.

109
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,200
Everything is cause and effect.

110
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,200
So work on the cause and don't worry about the effect.

111
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:13,200
As long as we're filled with the heart of loving kindness, then everything is already perfect.

112
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,200
So that's the three good roots when we don't have the three poisons.

113
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:23,200
Number four is one good root of all bodhisattva and that is called diligence.

114
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,200
All bodhisattva are very diligent.

115
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,200
They are vigorous day and night trying to save all sentient beings.

116
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:35,200
No matter how tough the situation gets, they will not turn back or give up.

117
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,200
Just like universal worthy bodhisattva.

118
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,200
My vows are endless.

119
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,200
Thought succeeding thought without interruption.

120
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,200
In bodily, vocal and mental deeds without weariness.

121
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,200
We want to be universal worthy bodhisattva.

122
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,200
So cultivate, foster good roots.

123
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:59,200
Number six is the offering of not forsaking the conduct of a bodhisattva.

124
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,200
A bodhisattva is an enlightened being who enlightens others.

125
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,200
A bodhisattva would think Buddha's heart is my heart.

126
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,200
Buddha's vows are my vows.

127
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,200
I use my vows to guide my conduct.

128
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,200
So every day he's thinking of how to save all sentient beings.

129
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,200
He's a rescuer.

130
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:24,200
He felt responsible for everybody's well-being and happiness and enlightenment.

131
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,200
He has no time to lament over his own problems.

132
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,200
He only think about others.

133
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,200
And a bodhisattva, he has a special trait.

134
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:37,200
No matter how badly other people treat him, he will not hold it against them.

135
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,200
He will never be irritated or lose his temper.

136
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,200
That's a true bodhisattva.

137
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,200
Also a bodhisattva would be humble.

138
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,200
He will not brag about himself.

139
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,200
Because he really understands non-self.

140
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,200
So be a bodhisattva.

141
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,200
That's honoring Buddha.

142
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:59,200
Number seven is the offering of not abandoning the bodhi mind.

143
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,200
Bodhi mind is our treasure.

144
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,200
It's our awakened mind.

145
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,200
It consists of three parts.

146
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,200
Number one, straightforwardness.

147
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,200
Always contemplate on the principle of suchness.

148
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,200
We have the perfect Buddha nature within us.

149
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,200
We are the pure consciousness.

150
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:22,200
So in this world, what we do is adapt to conditions but never change.

151
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,200
Remain steadfast while according with all conditions.

152
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,200
So we are in this world but not of this world.

153
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,200
We are actually with our Buddha nature.

154
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,200
That way you will have a really peaceful and happy life.

155
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,200
Number two is profoundness.

156
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,200
Profoundness is deep belief in accumulating all kinds of goodness.

157
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,200
So deep that it's to our bones.

158
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,200
No matter what happens, we only remember to be good.

159
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,200
Number three is great compassion.

160
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,200
Every Buddha, they take the heart of great compassion.

161
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,200
They want to uproot the suffering of all sentient beings.

162
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,200
Because of great compassion, we develop the bodhi mind.

163
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,200
Because of the bodhi mind, we become enlightened.

164
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,200
Every Buddha follows the same path.

165
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,200
Therefore, the greatest offering is the offering of the Dharma.

166
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,200
We actually don't need any money.

167
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,200
We just need to have the sincere heart of cultivation.

168
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,200
That's the best offering to Buddha.

169
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,200
That way we are accumulating infinite merits and virtues.

170
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,200
And we officially become the same family as Buddha.

171
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,200
So thank you for listening.

172
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,200
A-bi-to-fo.
