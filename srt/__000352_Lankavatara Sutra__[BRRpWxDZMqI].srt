1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,620
We are going to talk about the Lankavatara Sutra.

2
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:25,720
This is the only sutra that the first patriarch of Zen Buddhism Bodhidharma passed down to

3
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:32,600
the second patriarch Hui Ke, from master to master, Buddha to Buddha.

4
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:41,280
The word Lanka is actually a city, like Sri Lanka, is the city on the top of the mountain.

5
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,060
Avatara is the ultimate jewel.

6
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:51,360
The whole mountain is made out of precious jewels, that's the place where Buddha is.

7
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,680
It's very difficult to get to, almost impossible.

8
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,460
It's treacherous and dangerous.

9
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,000
How do we get there?

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,500
We will try to explain the sutra as a whole in terms of the four doctrines.

11
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:14,080
One is the five dharmas, the second one is the three natures, then we have the eight

12
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,860
consciousnesses, then two kinds of no-self.

13
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,560
So you just have to remember them like the telephone number.

14
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,560
Five, three, eight, two.

15
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,560
Everything is described as the five dharmas.

16
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,120
The first dharma is name.

17
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:38,140
We give everything an identity, a name.

18
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:43,200
For example, we have me, I, and my mom, my dad, we label everything with a name.

19
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:51,800
We might like name brand, such as Louis Vuitton, or Mercedes, or Rolex, we give value based

20
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,340
on fabricated concept of the dharma.

21
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,340
Very important.

22
00:01:54,340 --> 00:02:02,540
of our mind. The sutra is letting us know that everything is created by our mind only.

23
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:11,300
There's nothing existing outside of our mind. This name is also fabricated from our mind.

24
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:18,720
Number two is appearances. We have name, we have appearances. That means all the forms

25
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:27,040
that you see in this world of phenomenon, a thing, person, event, is all appearances.

26
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:35,360
We attach to these appearances. We start having emotions and we create karma. We might have

27
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:43,440
greed, anger, or ignorance based on attaching to all the life situations.

28
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,720
So we arrive to number three, our discrimination.

29
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:55,840
Our conceptual mind. Because we are attached to the name and attached to the appearances,

30
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:04,160
we start having discrimination. We think in terms of duality. What is beneficial to me?

31
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:12,360
What is gain? What is loss? What is pleasure? What is pain? This discrimination itself is

32
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,980
already full of the idea of me, the ego.

33
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,720
We think in terms of duality.

34
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:27,800
That's how we discriminate. These three dharmas are the world of a mundane person.

35
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:36,160
How do we ascend to a different world? We need to understand that name, appearances,

36
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:44,120
and our discrimination are only false images created by our mind.

37
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,720
That's how we have number four, right knowledge.

38
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,720
Right knowledge.

39
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:57,720
And number five, suchness, the reality. We learn Buddhism to see the truth of the world.

40
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:05,400
It's called right knowledge. This is the inner state of self-realization of noble wisdom.

41
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:14,840
We can call it prajna. This wisdom is the insight, knowing the illusory nature of name,

42
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,680
appearances, the object of the world, and the world. This wisdom is the insight, knowing the illusory nature of name, appearances, the object of the world, and the world.

43
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,720
This wisdom is the insight, knowing the illusory nature of name, appearances, the object of the world, and the world.

44
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,720
This wisdom is the insight, knowing the illusory nature of name, appearances, the object of the world, and the world.

45
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,720
And our discrimination, the subject of the world.

46
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,720
It's called right knowledge.

47
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,000
They are both only made from the mind.

48
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,460
If we can get away from the conceptual mind, that would be the real awareness, the true

49
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,660
insight, the right knowledge.

50
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:45,720
If we can wake up to the reality, we will see the ultimate truth, which is our true

51
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,720
suchness.

52
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,720
Right knowledge.

53
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:55,560
When the name and the appearances are put away, the discrimination will cease.

54
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:06,220
That which is remained is the Buddha nature, the nature of all things, ultimate pure reality.

55
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,640
This is the absolute truth.

56
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,740
Only this is real.

57
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:20,480
When you reach here, you also let go of the idea of suchness, because all names and all

58
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,140
labels are just concepts.

59
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,120
We let it go as well.

60
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,340
These five dharmas consist of all things.

61
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:35,360
Now we explain them in terms of the three natures and eight consciousnesses.

62
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,720
The name and appearances are called the other dependent nature.

63
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,680
How do they come about?

64
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:48,160
They are other dependent, dependent on cause and effect.

65
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,960
Without cause and effect, you will have no name or appearances.

66
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,400
This cause and effect is actually from our own alaya consciousness.

67
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:05,820
We have this big storehouse that stores all our karmic seeds from many, many, many prior

68
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,820
lifetimes.

69
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,560
All our thoughts, all our actions, they are seeds.

70
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,800
Or we call it habit energy or impression.

71
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,500
When the conditions are right, they will ripen into what we call the phenomenon world.

72
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:27,860
So everything you see in the phenomenon world, they are not as real as you think.

73
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:32,000
They are actually created from our alaya consciousness.

74
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,720
It's like an ever-spanning whirlpool.

75
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,720
It doesn't stop.

76
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,020
It keeps accumulating seeds.

77
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,240
From moment to moment.

78
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,560
And these seeds are developed from the first seven consciousness.

79
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:54,020
This circle, which is the sixth consciousness, it includes all five consciousnesses before

80
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,180
this.

81
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:03,240
So our eye consciousness, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind.

82
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,900
That's how we conceptualize, see, and experience the world.

83
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,260
But this is based on the seven consciousnesses.

84
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,920
The seven consciousness, the ego.

85
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:17,220
We love ourselves so much, we think the alaya consciousness is me.

86
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,620
And we base all our thinking on the smallness.

87
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,920
And whatever we think becomes our action, becomes our words.

88
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,880
We have greed, anger, and ignorance.

89
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,420
And we create killing, stealing, and lust.

90
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:36,480
All these get stored back into the alaya consciousness.

91
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,480
A seed.

92
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,480
A seed.

93
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,340
Have been energies.

94
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,020
They were ripened into result.

95
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:47,600
All these is created by this deluded mind.

96
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,400
This is not our Buddha nature.

97
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,780
This is an ignorantTHIS IS WHEN WE ARE FULL OF THE SELF.

98
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,360
Buddha nature have no self.

99
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,640
This is Buddha nature.

100
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,480
This is our deluded mind.

101
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,140
If you understand it's illusory nature.

102
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,140
No longer attached your outside.

103
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:14,140
outside world. This laya consciousness itself, when it's purified, it is the

104
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:21,100
suchness. It is the true reality. Living in the laya, we are living in a dream

105
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:27,700
state. When someone is yelling at us, we think it's so real, we become very angry.

106
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:33,880
If we know there is not the person outside of us and not the words and not

107
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:40,240
ourselves, then we will no longer be angry because we perceive it as real. We

108
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,880
become angry. Or we have to get the Louis Vuitton bag or the Mercedes because we

109
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:54,220
perceive them as very valuable. If we can only see this is only a life that we

110
00:08:54,220 --> 00:09:01,600
fabricated from our laya consciousness, we will be awakened. All you have to know

111
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,500
is illusory.

112
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:11,000
Oftentimes, we describe them in terms of these three natures. The nature of all

113
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,300
things, which is dependent on conditions, wandering thoughts, our false

114
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:23,320
imagination, and the fully accomplished nature is our true suchness. If we always

115
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:29,860
live in the conceptualized nature, in our conceptualized thinking, we are like

116
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,860
the audience who's watching and completely

117
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:40,980
absorbed in this movie, thinking it's real. We're caught up in this drama of life.

118
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:47,820
If we can see it's only made out of cause and condition, we are like the actors. We

119
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:55,340
know we're making a film. We're only acting right now. That's a higher insight of

120
00:09:55,340 --> 00:10:03,780
wisdom. But if you can become the director, directing your whole life, your emotion, and

121
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,940
realizing that your intention is not constantly

122
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:12,700
controlled by the ups and downs of the world without the conceptualization, without the

123
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:21,820
discrimination, then you will realize these two kinds of no self egolessness of persons,

124
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,760
egolessness

125
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,340
of things. Right now, we are ignorant. We think there

126
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:31,360
is a real permanent me. And we think everything outside of us is really present part of us.

127
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,760
But if you follow my standard, I'm gonna let you in on this. I'm gonna explain

128
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,760
about me first. We can see you. They can see you. I can see you freely. I can also see you.

129
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:42,460
existing. These two beliefs is hindering us from becoming a Buddha. But when you're awakened,

130
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:50,020
you will realize there's no such thing as I or ego. It's only a fabrication. There's

131
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:58,620
no me and there's no things. That's why it's called Yogyakarta, consciousness only. Everything

132
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:09,740
is only manifestation of our mind. And that is the truth. That is reality. Through meditation,

133
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:17,160
contemplate on this fact. One day you will come to this awakening that everything is

134
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:26,060
only a dream. When you have this kind of insight, you can be a true Bodhisattva. You live this

135
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,600
life not attached to anyone.

136
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:40,100
But help everyone to become enlightened. That's someone who is awakened. This is when we reach

137
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:46,520
the top of the mountain. Even though it's treacherous and difficult, we will get there

138
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:54,360
eventually. The Sutra keeps saying everything is unborn. Unborn means there's no actual

139
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,640
rising or ceasing or abiding.

140
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,560
When you see the Buddha, you will be enlightened. When you see the Buddha, you will be enlightened.

141
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:58,580
When you see the Buddha, you will be enlightened. When you see the Buddha, you will be enlightened.

142
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:02,320
It is really cardboarded. You are the DISCOVERY OF THE DEVрей, the threefold meaning

143
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,760
of all existence in this world. You don't need

144
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,880
to want anything. You only need the real truth. You will no longer need the LV bag.

145
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,820
You will no longer need Mercedes to make you Happy. They are only the condition arising.

146
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:16,480
You will have a lot of knowledge, and you will not be offended when other people are

147
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:24,320
passing judgement on you or hurting your feelings. It's only your karma coming from your liya

148
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,540
consciousness. Nothing is for real. on your or hurting your feeling. It's only your karma

149
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:37,440
a dream for you to come to realization and reach this epiphany. That's when we will

150
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,240
