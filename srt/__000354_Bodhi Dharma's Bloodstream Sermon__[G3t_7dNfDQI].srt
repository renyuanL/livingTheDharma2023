1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,960
Today we are going to talk about Bodhidharma's Bloodstream Sermon.

2
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,880
Everything in the Three Realms is created by our mind.

3
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,600
Our mind is the Buddha.

4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,000
Beyond this mind, you will not find another Buddha.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,960
To look for a Buddha outside of our mind is impossible.

6
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,100
This sermon contains five main questions and answers.

7
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,040
We will briefly go over them.

8
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,440
Hopefully, it will help us believe that our mind is the Buddha.

9
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:49,160
The first question, why don't we see this mind when a person's body dies?

10
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,040
Bodhidharma's answer is the mind is always present.

11
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,060
You just don't see it.

12
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,960
Our mind is always with us.

13
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:06,300
Our eyes see form, our ears hear sound, our nose smells odor, our tongue tastes flavor.

14
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,680
All the movement and our state is our entire mind.

15
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,700
That's our miraculous awareness.

16
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:18,040
We just don't know that is our true mind because we're attached to the external forms.

17
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,360
So we do not know that is our true awareness.

18
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,920
We are in this physical body that has life and death.

19
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,960
But even when we die.

20
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,960
Our true mind never dies.

21
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,960
Our true mind never dies.

22
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,800
Our true mind never dies.

23
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,660
It's pure and genuine.

24
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,160
It's everlasting.

25
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:38,140
Master Guang Qing, he is a prominent Buddhist monk in Pure Land Buddhism.

26
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:43,600
When he passed away in the age of 93, his last words were,

27
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,480
no coming, no going, nothing happening.

28
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,840
Why did he say that?

29
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,660
Because he's talking about our true nature.

30
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,280
Our true nature has no birth or death.

31
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,540
So no coming, no going.

32
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,660
So no coming, no going.

33
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,900
and it's permanent. The Pure Land is actually our mind. That's why nothing is happening.

34
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:08,840
Our mind is really beyond the limitation of this physical body.

35
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:17,380
Number two, if the mind is present, why don't I see it? Bodhidharma says all appearances

36
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:26,600
are illusions. The only reason we do not see our true nature is because we are attached

37
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:34,220
to all appearances. We think the physical world is the only reality. We forgot we have

38
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:41,980
this divine nature because we are so caught up in our life situations. Maybe it's poverty.

39
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:47,780
Maybe it's sickness. Maybe it's depression because we think they are so real. We cannot

40
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:53,720
believe that we have this Buddha nature. We totally forget and we cannot believe who we

41
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,420
really are. That's why we never see it.

42
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:01,920
right now is to know that all appearances are only made from the mind.

43
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,420
Nothing is real as we perceive, they're like what's happening in the dream.

44
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:13,920
If we're free from all attachments to appearances, we will match with our Buddha nature.

45
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:21,220
All we have to do is to let go our clinging to the outside situation, it does not define us.

46
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:27,720
We are a divine Buddha, we just have to believe and see beyond what is going on right now.

47
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:33,720
Number three, why shouldn't we worship Buddhas and Bodhisattvas?

48
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:40,720
Bodhidharma says the Buddha is your own mind, don't misdirect your worship.

49
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:47,720
A lot of people or other religions, they might judge Buddhism thinking we are worshipping statues.

50
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,220
Bodhidharma is telling us we are not worshipping.

51
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:56,720
We are worshipping a statue, we are only worshipping to know our own nature.

52
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:03,720
Again, all appearances are illusion, so the Buddha statue is also illusion.

53
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:10,220
We only bow to remind us we are the Buddha, there's no Buddha outside.

54
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:17,720
If you always seek Buddha outside with the conditioned existence, you will never find the Buddha.

55
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,720
If a Buddha or a Bodhisattva,

56
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,720
suddenly appears in front of you, do not embrace it or attach to it,

57
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:32,720
because they can easily be demons who disguise themselves as Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

58
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,720
Our true mind is empty of any forms.

59
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,720
As long as you have a form, you will not succeed in seeing your own nature.

60
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:47,720
If you recite a lot of sutras, you hold a lot of precepts, you bow to the Buddha all the time,

61
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,720
you will have good karma, but you will not find the Buddha.

62
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,720
So let go of your attachment to the Buddha images, even sutras.

63
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,720
Everything here, they're just words to help you understand your own nature.

64
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,720
None of the words are for you to attach to.

65
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,720
They're only here for you to see who you really are.

66
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,720
So let go of all the forms and you will find your true nature as it is.

67
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,720
Number four, since married laymen don't give up sex.

68
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,720
How can they become Buddhas?

69
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:29,720
Bodhidharma says, I only talk about seeing your nature, I don't talk about sex.

70
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,720
We are married laymen, can we still be Buddha?

71
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,720
Bodhidharma is very straightforward.

72
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,720
He says, laymen are Buddhas too, if they find their true nature.

73
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:49,720
If you do not find your true nature and you shave your head, you are only a fanatic, not a real Buddha.

74
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,720
Real Buddha is someone who knows who they are.

75
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,720
When you see your own nature, sex is immaterial.

76
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:03,720
You will not enjoy having it anymore because we are only in this physical body.

77
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:12,720
Even if you still have habits remaining, it will not harm you because our nature is essentially pure.

78
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,720
It can never be corrupted.

79
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,720
As long as you have a renounced mind, you are a Buddha.

80
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,720
Even if you are a layman.

81
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:27,720
Number five, butchers create karma by slaughtering animals.

82
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,720
How can they be Buddhas?

83
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:37,720
Bodhidharma says, I only talk about seeing your nature, I don't talk about creating karma.

84
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:43,720
This is talking about people that have done bad deeds, like a butcher, killing.

85
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,720
But who doesn't have a past?

86
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,720
Nobody is born a Buddha.

87
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,720
Everybody has a dark side.

88
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,720
Everybody has bad thoughts.

89
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:57,720
But that doesn't mean they cannot be Buddhas because the nature is within all of us.

90
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,720
Nobody is lesser than a Buddha.

91
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,720
So we have to see beyond the karma.

92
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,720
Karma is conditioned existence.

93
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,720
All the good deeds create good karma.

94
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,720
Bad deeds create bad karma.

95
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,720
But that's not the ultimate liberation.

96
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,720
The real liberation is seeing your nature.

97
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,720
Then you go beyond karma.

98
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,720
There is something that is beyond the karma that we are seeing right now.

99
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,720
As long as you go back to your true nature.

100
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,720
In conclusion, it doesn't matter when you die in this lifetime.

101
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,720
It doesn't matter how you are in your life situation.

102
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,720
It doesn't matter if you worship Buddha or not.

103
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,720
It doesn't matter if you are married.

104
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,720
It doesn't matter if you have done a lot of bad deeds.

105
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,720
All it matters is you see who you really are.

106
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,720
You are the Buddha.

107
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,720
Your mind is the Buddha.

108
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,720
Buddha is your mind.

109
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,720
There is no Buddha outside of your mind.

110
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,720
There is not the mind without the Buddha.

111
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:09,720
That is what Bodhidharma, the first patriarch of Zen Buddhism is teaching us in this Bloodstream Sermon.

112
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,720
We are truly descendants of Buddha's bloodline.

113
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,720
If you can believe in it, then you are the Buddha right now.

114
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,720
You don't have to do anything else.

115
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,720
The practice is only condition arising.

116
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,720
It's not the ultimate result.

117
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,720
The result is you are the Buddha.

118
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,720
That's all you have to realize.

119
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,720
That's all you have to know.

120
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,720
So that's the class for today.

121
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,720
Thank you for listening.

122
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,720
Amitabha.
