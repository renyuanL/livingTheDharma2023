1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,520
Today we are going to talk about Ten Mystical Doorways.

2
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:25,160
In the Huayen school of Buddhism, it talks about the Dharma realm, which is the world

3
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,160
of our pure mind.

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,940
So it talks about fourfold Dharma realm.

5
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:36,280
The first world is the world of phenomenon, which is the physical world that we live in.

6
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:44,000
The second is the world of the noumenon, which is the world of the mind that is invisible.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,920
Then we have the world where there is non-obstruction between the phenomenon and the noumenon.

8
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:58,540
That means all the physical world is actually created by our mind and all the physical world

9
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:02,240
is just an expression of our pure mind.

10
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:07,800
Lastly is the world of non-obstruction accounts for all phenomena.

11
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:15,020
In every physical world phenomenon it is resembling our true Buddha nature.

12
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,620
We want to go back to this world where all the phenomenon is our true Buddha natural sounded Buddha and a suggests to learn the new world fully.

13
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,500
Love what you say.

14
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:20,780
Value what you say.

15
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:20,900
Thank you so much!

16
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:28,040
Buddha mind. So always see the true nature in our daily lives. Now let's look at the

17
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:36,820
10 mystical doorways. Number one, simultaneous completion and mutual interaction. All the

18
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:43,620
phenomena, they're complete at the same time and they're mutually interacting. We often use the

19
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:51,540
example of the one drop of water is the same as the entire ocean. Living in this world,

20
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:59,140
we are just one drop of water when we are being the selfish self. But in actuality,

21
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:07,060
we are the entire ocean that's vast without any boundaries. But this one drop of water

22
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:13,540
contains the entire ocean. The entire ocean is in this one drop of water.

23
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:21,800
So this is the incredible nature of our true mind. Number two is the unhindered and easy

24
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:29,600
intersection between the vast and the narrow. Here, the comparison is between the vast,

25
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:36,240
which is as a whole, and the narrow is specific parts or particular parts. For example,

26
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:43,100
we are in a company. The entire company is the vast. The one single employee,

27
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:52,240
or the employer, that is the narrow. Every employee symbolizes the entire company. And

28
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:59,200
everybody is equal in this world of the Buddha. So the president is the same as the janitor

29
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,740
because in our true Buddha nature, nobody is different from others. We are all one of the same.

30
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:12,240
The contribution of the president and the janitor is the same. They just do their part differently,

31
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,600
but they are equal. So the unhindered and easy intersection between the vast and the narrow.

32
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:20,960
We are equal in their Buddha nature. When we work in this company, everybody works together as a team.

33
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:27,860
Nobody is higher than others, which is doing our part the best that we can. So in this world of the

34
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:35,380
Buddha, it's the world of harmony. It's the utopia. So by learning the Amutasaka Sutra,

35
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:43,100
we want to learn the world of the Buddha. We are learning to work together as one in our society,

36
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:49,760
in our company, in our country. Amitabha's Pure Land, it's the same kind of world. The world of

37
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:58,080
the perfect mind. Number three is one and many containing one another, yet being different.

38
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:07,160
So number two is comparing the vast and the narrow. Now it's comparing one and many. One

39
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:12,780
and many is the same in the world of the Buddha. Just like in the Samantabhadra,

40
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:20,800
Bodhisattva's 10 Great Vows, his one body will manifest into infinite bodies and every

41
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:27,960
single body will be in front of infinite Buddhas. He made one prostration, one bow, his bow

42
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:34,980
to infinite Buddha. Because this is the power of our mind. So when we are praying, when

43
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:41,940
we are chanting Amitabha, we are as grand as the Buddha, our sound will travel to infinite

44
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,560
world. It's the same thing. And here's what we are doing. We are working together as a

45
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,900
in front of infinite Buddhas. You've got to believe the power of your mind when you're

46
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:53,680
doing any kind of spiritual practice. Some people they chant the Buddha's name or they

47
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:00,340
chant the compassion mantra, the water will return to compassionate water that will cure

48
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:07,440
people's disease. How is that possible? Because the power of our mind. When we concentrate

49
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,420
single-mindedly, the power of our mind is incredible. This is the same as the power

50
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:20,380
of attraction. What you think about, you will attract into your life. All the phenomenon

51
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:28,680
is created by noumenon. Our mind is the vibration that creates the reality, the physical world.

52
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:34,500
We really have to believe it when we are studying the Amitāsaka Sutra.

53
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,420
Number four is mutual identity.

54
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:43,800
Mutual identity of all dharmas in freedom and ease. Everybody has an individual identity,

55
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:50,540
but we can all be in harmony as one. Just like all the religions, Christian, there's

56
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:57,600
Catholic, there's Buddhism, we can all mutually have our own identity, believe in our religion,

57
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:04,480
but we have to be in harmony, mutually respect each other. Buddha want us to open up our

58
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,400
mind so everybody can live in harmony.

59
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:16,580
Have true respect to each other as if everyone is a Buddha. When you see everyone as Buddha,

60
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:22,960
you are enlightened. Your true Buddha nature will come about. We have our own identity,

61
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:31,680
but everyone is together as one. There shouldn't be any wars, conflicts, or arguments or problems.

62
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,300
In the world of the mind, everything is perfect. That's why it's called the Ten Mystical

63
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:44,520
Doorways. Everything is ten in this Hawaiian school of Buddhism. Ten is not a number. Ten

64
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,700
means perfect in Buddha's mind. And we all have the Buddha mind.

65
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:56,740
Number five, the hidden and the revealed being established together. Now it's comparing what

66
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:04,480
is hidden and what is revealed. Hidden is the noumenon that is unseen. It's not in any

67
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,480
form.

68
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:12,040
We have the revealed, which is all the phenomenon that we see in our physical life. In Buddhism,

69
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:19,620
we talk about the ultimate truth and the relative truth. What we see in the world, the phenomenon,

70
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:25,920
is the relative truth or the conventional truth. But the hidden, the noumenon, is the

71
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:33,040
ultimate truth, the emptiness. So we want to be able to see they are established together.

72
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,240
The noumenon is the phenomenon.

73
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:43,800
The phenomenon is the noumenon. What we look like right now is what's revealed, our appearance.

74
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:52,120
When your heart is beautiful, kind, and compassionate, what reveals on the outside will be pretty.

75
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:58,220
Everybody would love to look at you without any cosmetic surgeries or makeups. Cultivate

76
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:04,960
your heart so you're full of compassion and real love for all sentient beings. The Buddha

77
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:12,500
said, the soulless mind is the unconditional loving mind, the loving kindness, the great

78
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:17,960
compassion. So bring out this great compassion that is innate in all of us.

79
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:25,340
Number 6, establishment and inter-containment of the subtle and minute. A big container

80
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:32,520
can fit many little things. Little things can fit in a big container. Why is that? Because

81
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,520
big and small are both huge.

82
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,520
Small things are both huge and big are both small.

83
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:42,420
small, it's just relative. In the world of the noumenon, there is no obstruction or hindrance

84
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:47,980
between big and small. You're saying that's impossible. How can big thing be contained

85
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:53,780
in the little thing? That's the world of the Buddha. All the Buddha and Bodhisattva, they

86
00:08:53,780 --> 00:09:00,640
have supernatural powers. It's actually within all of us. If we just go back to our original

87
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:07,480
enlightened mind, we all have this kind of abilities. For a Bodhisattva, miracles is

88
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:13,000
normal. We should have a miraculous life. All your dreams are supposed to come true.

89
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:20,580
Whatever we desire, we can manifest in this world. When we meditate, we can heal our own

90
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:26,680
bodies. Healing this physical body is not difficult. We can all do that if we really

91
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,640
believe in it, then it will come into fruition.

92
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:39,560
Number 7, Dharma rounds like Indra's net. Indra is the heavenly being who has a huge

93
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:46,700
net containing thousands of pearls. Each pearl contains the reflection of the others. So

94
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:53,080
it's multiple reflections of each other. When we are in touch with our true mind, you

95
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:59,620
are in me, I am in you. Everybody is together as one because we have this connection. We

96
00:09:59,620 --> 00:09:59,640
have this connection. We have this connection. We have this connection. We have this connection.

97
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,080
We have this connection. We are in the same Dharma body. Everyone is the same as you.

98
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:10,560
Nobody is outside of you because you created everybody. If you really understand that

99
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:16,780
everyone in your life is created by yourself, you will not have people that you dislike

100
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,560
or hate. That means that you are hating yourself.

101
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:28,940
Number 8, relying on phenomenon to reveal Dharma's and produce understanding. Relying

102
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:36,140
on the phenomenon to reveal the dharmas which is the noumenon we cannot see the world of the mind

103
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:42,740
but it's revealed through the physical world that we're living in right now for example if you're

104
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:48,860
cooking everybody with the same vegetable they will cook different kind of dishes everybody's

105
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:55,960
emotion everybody's feelings different so all your cooking all your artwork all your writing

106
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:03,180
everything you do is telling us how you are in your heart if you're full of love compassion

107
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:11,280
it's all showing up in your own life right now so use your mind wisely number nine different

108
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:19,820
accomplishment of separate dharmas of the 10 periods of time now is talking about time our

109
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:25,160
mind is without limitation in terms of time or space

110
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:25,940
time

111
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:34,160
and space are all relative created by our minds they should not hinder us in any way

112
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:42,720
10 periods of time we have the past present and future in the past there is past present

113
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:49,360
and future in the present there's also past present and future and in the future there's

114
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:55,920
also past present and future so three times three is nine plus one which is

115
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:03,940
meaning time is now it already is in the past of the present because dois sind состояни

116
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,160
now six times we're living

117
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,180
each dash of time also already is the past they are our own thinking our thoughts at this one

118
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:17,200
moment every period of time is within this one moment in time our one single thought nothing is

119
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,680
beyond this one single thought right now if we are not living with our true buddha nature we're

120
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,380
living in a dream state because we are not awakened to our true nature so see everything that you see in告白油

121
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,420
phenomena as a dream so you know no�

122
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:32,140
so you're not attached to your life right now but be the best you can be in this world

123
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:38,980
as a bodhisattva you can be as good as you can to everybody around you you have unconditional

124
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:44,500
love and you have no hatred no resentment because nothing really matters to you you

125
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:54,560
have no self number 10 perfect illumination and virtues of the main person and the companions

126
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:01,960
the main person usually is talking about the buddha because in one world there's only one

127
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:10,040
buddha but there will be many companions many bodhisattvas to support this buddha for example

128
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:18,360
shakamoni buddha samantabhadra bodhisattva and manjushri bodhisattva they are supporting

129
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:24,540
shakamoni buddha but their merits are exactly the same you cannot say one buddha to the

130
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:32,080
one is higher than the others they are all talking about our own buddha nature so we

131
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:38,880
are shakamoni buddha we are the bodhisattva you should have the compassion just like they

132
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:47,620
are so this is the 10 mystical doorway of the world of the buddhas you should not think

133
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:53,280
that this is only the world of the buddhas it has nothing to do with you buddha tells

134
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,480
us all the sutras

135
00:13:54,540 --> 00:14:02,160
so we can be like him if it has nothing to do with us he will not expand the dharma the

136
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:09,740
buddha nature is innate in all of us so there's no reason why we cannot live in this perfect

137
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:15,580
world of the buddha all you have to do is believe then incredible things will really

138
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:20,340
come into your lives so that's the class for today thank you for listening amitabha
