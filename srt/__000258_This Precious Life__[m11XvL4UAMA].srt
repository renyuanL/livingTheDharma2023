1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,160
Today we are going to talk about this precious life.

2
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,360
Most of us never stop to think about how precious our lives are.

3
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,160
Hopefully this class will help us to realize the value of this life.

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,160
We have a verse in Buddhism. It says,

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,160
It is rare to be reborn as human, but I am living as one now.

6
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,160
It is difficult to encounter the Dharma, but I have come across it now.

7
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,160
If I do not cultivate this lifetime, when would I have a chance to be liberated?

8
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,160
It is rare to be reborn as a human being.

9
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,160
Buddha said it is very difficult to have the human rebirth.

10
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,160
Buddha gives the example of a blind turtle.

11
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,160
As if there is a plank floating in the vast ocean,

12
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,160
and there is a hole in the middle of this plank.

13
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:09,160
The chance of us reincarnating as a human is as rare as a blind sea turtle

14
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,160
who is surfacing above water once every 100 years,

15
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,160
coincidentally its head poking through the hole of this plank.

16
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,160
That's the chance of us becoming a human again.

17
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,160
The second example is thread needle.

18
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,160
As if we cast a thread down the mountain,

19
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,160
and when it reaches the bottom, it threads through the eye of a needle.

20
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,160
Buddha gave another metaphor, a handful of soil.

21
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,160
One day Buddha was teaching his disciples.

22
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:43,160
He grabbed a handful of soil and asked his disciples,

23
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,160
Is there more soil in my hand or on the ground?

24
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,160
A disciple replied, There is more soil on the ground.

25
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,160
Buddha proclaimed,

26
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:56,160
To have the human rebirth is like the soil in my hand.

27
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,160
To lose the human rebirth is like the soil on the ground.

28
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:05,160
The number of humans compared to all other sentient beings are very small.

29
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,160
But there's billions of people on this earth.

30
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,160
How can that be?

31
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:16,160
But if you think about it, there's a lot more bugs, plants, and organisms on this earth than there are humans.

32
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,160
So we know that the number of humans are very small

33
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,160
relative to all other sentient beings.

34
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,160
So why is it so important to be a human?

35
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,160
Because if you're an animal, you don't have the wisdom to cultivate.

36
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,160
If you're in the hungry ghost or hell realm,

37
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,160
you are having too much suffering to cultivate.

38
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,160
And if you're a heavenly being or in the asura realm,

39
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,160
you are too happy to cultivate.

40
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,160
Only humans have sorrows and happiness.

41
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,160
We have just enough so we can cultivate this lifetime.

42
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,160
And we have three things that are better

43
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,160
than heavenly beings.

44
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,160
One is our memory.

45
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,160
We can remember what we did wrong

46
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,160
and we can reflect and change our ways.

47
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,160
Number two, we can hold precepts and learn to be virtuous.

48
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,160
And number three, we are very diligent.

49
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,160
We can diligently practice.

50
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,160
These three things were actually better than heavenly beings.

51
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:15,160
All the Buddhas, they became Buddhas in the human realm.

52
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,160
So it's very precious that we have this human life right now.

53
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,160
It is difficult to imagine

54
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,160
to encounter the Dharma,

55
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,160
but I have come across it now.

56
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,160
Buddha is not here right now,

57
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,160
so it's very difficult to hear the Dharma.

58
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,160
Now we still have the Dharma,

59
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,160
but to hear the Dharma and to believe the Dharma

60
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,160
and actually practice it,

61
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,160
it is actually very rare.

62
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,160
We are very blessed to have this opportunity.

63
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,160
That means we already cultivated many lives before.

64
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,160
We have to treasure the Dharma that we have right now.

65
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,160
Especially we know of the Pure Land Buddhism

66
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,160
that is like winning the lottery.

67
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,160
In the commentary of Amitabha Sutra by Ohi Master,

68
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,160
he said to recite Amitabha Buddha's name

69
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,160
and to go to the Western Pure Land,

70
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,160
we immediately have the certain complete attainment

71
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,160
of the three non-regressions.

72
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,160
One, precision.

73
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,160
Two, practice.

74
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,160
Three, mindfulness.

75
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,160
Non-regression is never fall back.

76
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,160
First, we will never fall back in our position.

77
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,160
We will always be an art hat

78
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,160
who is a saint,

79
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,160
who already got rid of the ego

80
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,160
and have no more self.

81
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,160
We will never fall less than a saint,

82
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,160
than an art hat.

83
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,160
So that's the non-regression of precision.

84
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,160
Number two, we will never fall back

85
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,160
in our Bodhisattva practice.

86
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,160
Here, we are always falling back.

87
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,160
When we try to help someone,

88
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,160
when someone yells at us

89
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,160
and we don't want to do it anymore

90
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,160
because we give up.

91
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,160
But over there,

92
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,160
we will never diminish in our Bodhi resolve

93
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,160
and our compassion for all sentient beings.

94
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,160
So we'll never fall back in our Bodhisattva practice

95
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,160
and our Bodhi resolve.

96
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,160
Number three,

97
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,160
we will never fall back in our mindfulness.

98
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,160
Our every thought is like a Buddha.

99
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,160
We enter the ocean of all knowledge.

100
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,160
That's the Buddha's wisdom.

101
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,160
In all other practices,

102
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,160
these are three different stages of Bodhisattva.

103
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,160
But in Pure Land Buddhism,

104
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,160
by reciting Amitabha Buddha's name,

105
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,160
we have all three of these all at once.

106
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,160
It's like you are going to elementary school,

107
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,160
high school and college all at one time.

108
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,160
Why?

109
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,160
That's because of the ultimate reality

110
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,160
of the true nature of the mind

111
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,160
and the special effect of reciting Buddha's name

112
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,160
and the great vows of Amitabha.

113
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,160
Because of these three inconceivable powers,

114
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,160
that's why we can have certain complete attainment

115
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,160
of the three non-regressions all at once.

116
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,160
That's the amazing thing about the Pure Land Buddhism.

117
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,160
If I do not cultivate this lifetime,

118
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,160
we really need to cultivate right now,

119
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,160
this lifetime.

120
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,160
According to the visualization sutra,

121
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,160
it says if you want to go to the Western Pure Land

122
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,160
with the highest grade of lotus flower,

123
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,160
you have to have this pure land.

124
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,160
These three minds.

125
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,160
One is the most sincere mind.

126
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,160
Two, the mind of deep faith.

127
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,160
Three, aspiring rebirth by transferring merits.

128
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,160
Number one, most sincere mind.

129
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,160
This mind is without any wandering thoughts,

130
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,160
wholeheartedly at the present moment,

131
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,160
chanting the Buddha's name.

132
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,160
You are no longer caught up with the worldly dramas

133
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,160
and the entanglements of the world.

134
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,160
You are fully residing

135
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,160
in your spiritual practice,

136
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,160
chanting the Amitabha Buddha's name,

137
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,160
and you are with your Buddha nature.

138
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,160
That is called the most sincere mind.

139
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,160
We also have the mind of deep faith.

140
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,160
This faith is so strong that you're full of joy

141
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,160
every time you chant Buddha's name.

142
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,160
It's the goodness of all goodness,

143
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,160
the virtue of all virtue.

144
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,160
You love to chant.

145
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,160
You can recite the Buddha's name

146
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,160
when you are sick,

147
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,160
when you are dreaming in your sleep,

148
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,160
and when you're dying.

149
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,160
How do we know we really have this in our head?

150
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,160
It's when you first wake up in the morning

151
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,160
and your first thought is Amitabha.

152
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,160
That means you are pretty much there.

153
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,160
So that's the deep faith.

154
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,160
Number three is aspiring rebirth by transferring merits.

155
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,160
To transfer all the merit to all sentient beings.

156
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,160
Every Amitabha is for all sentient beings

157
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,160
because that's the same heart as Amitabha.

158
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,160
He created the Pure Land for us.

159
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,160
The Pure Land for us to become Buddha.

160
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,160
We should have the same great compassion

161
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,160
as Amitabha Buddha.

162
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,160
Last year, my aunt who has lung cancer

163
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,160
and stroke was in the hospital.

164
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,160
Her life was in danger.

165
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,160
All the doctors said there's nothing to do for her.

166
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,160
She's going to die any moment.

167
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,160
So we decided to take her back home.

168
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,160
Immediately when she arrived,

169
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,160
she started opening her eyes

170
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,160
and started talking to us.

171
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,160
We weren't sure what's going on,

172
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,160
but we were all chanting Amitabha.

173
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,160
Amitabha Buddha's name single-mindedly.

174
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,160
And every day she started getting better.

175
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,160
Now it's already May and she's still fine.

176
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,160
Through this whole experience,

177
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,160
what I learned is she is like a bodhisattva

178
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,160
that brought out the three minds in me.

179
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,160
I brought out my most sincere mind.

180
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,160
I have nothing else on my mind for those days.

181
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,160
I only thought about her and chanting for her.

182
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,160
And it brought out the mind of deep faith.

183
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,160
I completely relied on Amitabha Buddha.

184
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,160
If her time is up,

185
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,160
please take her to the Pure Land.

186
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,160
If it's not her time yet,

187
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,160
please make her recover.

188
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,160
So I completely trusted Amitabha.

189
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,160
And that's all I did every day is to chant for her.

190
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,160
So that's my deep faith.

191
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,160
And I brought out my great compassion.

192
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,160
I dedicated all my merits to her,

193
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,160
hoping it will help her to go to the Pure Land or recover.

194
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,160
And sure enough, there was a miracle.

195
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,160
So we should use life situation

196
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,160
to bring out our three minds.

197
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,160
Lastly, if I don't cultivate now,

198
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,160
when would I have a chance to be liberated?

199
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,160
We need to seize this opportunity to practice.

200
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,160
This is our last chance.

201
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,160
There's no more tries.

202
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,160
Buddha often gave the metaphor of the four types of horses.

203
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,160
The first type of horse,

204
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,160
when they see the shadow of the whip,

205
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,160
they start running.

206
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,160
That's as if someone who hears the Dharma

207
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,160
immediately knows that they should cultivate diligently.

208
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,160
The second type of horse,

209
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,160
when the whip barely grazes over the horse's hair,

210
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,160
it knows to start running.

211
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,160
That's the second type of people

212
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,160
who actually see people that are dying and suffering,

213
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,160
they know they should start cultivating.

214
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,160
The third kind of horse is

215
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,160
when the whip cuts through the flesh,

216
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,160
it starts running.

217
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,160
These are like people who already have their loved ones

218
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,160
suffering,

219
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,160
sick,

220
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,160
and dying.

221
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,160
That's when they start practicing.

222
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,160
The last kind of horse is

223
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,160
when the whip already pierces through the bone,

224
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,160
as if we are already sick ourselves,

225
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,160
and we are already dying.

226
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,160
Then we start practicing.

227
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,160
What kind of horse will you be?

228
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,160
Do you want to cultivate now,

229
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,160
or do you want to wait until your last moment?

230
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,160
Treasure this life that we have.

231
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,160
Don't be depressed or upset

232
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,160
about your current life situation.

233
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,160
It's all secondary.

234
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,160
What's most important is your own enlightenment,

235
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,160
is you going to the Pure Land

236
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,160
and becoming a Buddha.

237
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,160
In the Amitabha Sutra,

238
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,160
it says no one can be born in the Pure Land

239
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,160
with minor good roots,

240
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,160
blessings,

241
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,160
virtues,

242
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,160
and causal connections,

243
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,160
which means we need to have a lot of good roots,

244
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,160
merits,

245
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,160
and good conditions

246
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,160
in order to be born in the Pure Land.

247
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,160
We have all of that right now.

248
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,160
We are human,

249
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,160
and we believe in the Pure Land chanting,

250
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,160
and we are actually practicing it.

251
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,160
So we got ample of good roots right now.

252
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,160
We just need to hold on to our practice

253
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,160
and never give up,

254
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,160
and no matter what happens,

255
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,160
we just keep practicing until our last day.

256
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,160
Buddha will pick the time.

257
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,160
He will come take us to His Pure Land.

258
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,160
So that's the class for today.

259
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,160
Thank you for listening.

260
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,160
Amitabha.
