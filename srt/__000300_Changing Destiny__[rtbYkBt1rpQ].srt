1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,240
Today we will talk about changing destiny.

2
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,440
How do we change our destiny?

3
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,580
We need to change our mind.

4
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:28,780
We will use the three natures of the Yokakara school of Buddhism to transform our lives.

5
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:34,840
According to this conscious-only school of Buddhism, everything is created by our mind

6
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,840
alone.

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,900
Therefore, everything belongs to one of the three natures.

8
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,480
Number one, fully conceptualized nature.

9
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,580
It is the imaginary nature that is constructed of subject and object discrimination.

10
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,580
Our thinking is imaginary.

11
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:59,400
It is concepts that is constructed of the self, the subject, and others.

12
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:06,040
We always thinking in terms of the self, which is the ego, the seventh consciousness.

13
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:12,700
Because of our delusion, we have a lot of discrimination, thinking in terms of duality

14
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:20,640
based on the I, so we have gain or loss, good or bad, right or wrong, it's all fabricated

15
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,640
concepts.

16
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,440
We usually tell a funny story.

17
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,300
A story about a mother and her two sons.

18
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:33,640
One night, she went into the older son's room and saw the older son was holding a book

19
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,640
and sleeping.

20
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,800
Then she went to the younger son's room and also saw the younger son was holding a

21
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,200
book sleeping.

22
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,760
When the father came home, he asked, how are the boys doing with their studying today?

23
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,500
Because the mother disliked the older son, she said, oh, the older son is so lazy.

24
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,500
She said, oh, the older son is so lazy.

25
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,440
She said, oh, the older son is so lazy.

26
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,440
He is always falling asleep while studying.

27
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,440
The mother loves the younger son so she said, oh, he is so studious and so good, he is trying

28
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,440
to study even when he falls asleep.

29
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,740
So, even though she saw the same situation, but because of her different interpretation,

30
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:18,140
she would have different point of view and she would have different karmic retribution

31
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,140
because of this.

32
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,140
This is our discrimination and our attachment.

33
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,140
Because of our different interpretation, we have different point of view and we have different

34
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,140
karmic retribution because of this.

35
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,140
This is our discrimination and our attachment.

36
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,200
Because of this, we continue to reincarnate.

37
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,540
Number two, other dependent nature.

38
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,860
The flow of phenomena that arise from causes and conditions.

39
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,420
Other dependent is everything that we see as appearances.

40
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:44,480
They are dependent on causes and conditions.

41
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,800
This is what we see in the world.

42
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,380
Your family, your career, your body, your country.

43
00:02:52,380 --> 00:03:00,220
is appearances. That's basically our karma. It is from the wholesome and unwholesome karmic

44
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:06,860
seas and our alaya consciousness that manifests into appearances. They are like a mirage.

45
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:13,660
We don't understand that it's unreal and we become attached to them and start having delusions.

46
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:19,900
That is our problem. Our karma doesn't have problem in itself. It doesn't think it's good

47
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:25,900
or bad or gain or loss. It's all from our own concept and our thinking.

48
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:32,780
We need to recognize that our lives right now is the other dependent nature.

49
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:41,260
There was a girl born in 1960. Her name is Tian Tian Ming. Her father's first wife died young,

50
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:49,820
so a year later. Her father married the younger sister of the deceased wife and she gave birth

51
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:57,740
to this little girl, Tian Tian Ming. This girl is actually the reincarnation of the deceased wife.

52
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:04,220
When she was two years old, she was able to recall her previous life as the wife,

53
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:11,980
and her strong affection to her previous husband remains. Whenever the parents sat together,

54
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:19,340
she will show her jealousy by witching herself in between them. So in the Shravagama Sutra,

55
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:19,840
it says,

56
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:27,500
You love my heart, I endeavor your beauty. For this cause and condition, through hundreds

57
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:36,060
of thousands of kalpas, we are entangled together. Lifetime after lifetime, because of this karmic

58
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:42,620
attraction, we are reincarnating with the same group of people all the time.

59
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:49,580
When you really understand the other dependent nature, you will know that life is just a

60
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:57,100
process of karma showing up. Don't have any delusion about it. Stay calm. Know that everything

61
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:03,500
will pass. Treasure everyone in our life, but no matter it's good or bad relationship,

62
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:10,060
we want to turn our relationship into dharmic relationship where everybody will become

63
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:16,460
enlightened, where everybody will be out of the reincarnation. That's our goal for this life.

64
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,420
So see the other dependent nature,

65
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:24,140
without having fully conceptualized nature.

66
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:30,940
Number three, fully accomplished nature. If you don't have delusions of the fully

67
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:36,300
conceptualized nature, you will naturally have the fully accomplished nature,

68
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:42,540
which is the consummated nature that is perfect and complete. The true nature of things,

69
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:49,260
or we call it suchness, are buddha nature. When you don't have any delusions, then the

70
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:56,620
other dependent nature itself is actually returned to its true nature, which is emptiness.

71
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:04,220
There is nothing that really exists. All substance are void. There is nothing to attain, nothing to

72
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:12,220
gain. When you are still in your mind, you have no more dualism, have no more concept of the self,

73
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:18,780
and you will see the world in a whole different light. If we can see the other dependent nature,

74
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:26,060
have no real objective qualification of their own, that's enlightenment, the fully accomplished

75
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:32,940
nature. This is the treasure of our mind. This is the hidden bomb that's in our mind.

76
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:41,020
In order to change our destiny, we need to minimize our discrimination, our labeling

77
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:48,540
of the world from the self-interest point of view, but see the world from the point of view

78
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:55,820
of the fully accomplished nature, which is emptiness. How exactly do we do this? There is

79
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:03,100
meditation and ways that we can approach. There are two kinds of meditation. The first one is

80
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:11,260
meditation of everything as merely mind and consciousness. This is contemplating or meditating

81
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:18,380
on the first two natures, the fully conceptualized nature and the other dependent nature. Basically,

82
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:24,460
you see that you shouldn't have any delusions about the other dependent nature, because

83
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:31,180
everything is created from the mind. The mind is impermanent. When we have thoughts arising,

84
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:39,020
the previous thoughts fade away, the next thought will follow right behind it. It's always rising

85
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:47,660
and seizing the birth and death of our mind. This process cannot even be halted for a moment, so how

86
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,140
do we do it?

87
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:55,980
can we trust on this conditioned experience so see the emptiness keep contemplating on it

88
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:04,220
you will reach the samadhi of stillness of form you will see all phenomenon or appearances

89
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:12,620
all forms as emptiness then your mind will be still originally all phenomena are in motion

90
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:19,740
characterized by form and attributes but now they are still and unmoving number two

91
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:28,220
is the contemplation of suchness this is directly contemplating on the fully accomplished nature

92
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:35,100
if you have very good roots you can go directly to the fully accomplished nature and be away from

93
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:42,540
all duality knowing that there's no reproduction or extinction the buddha nature is never

94
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:50,780
rising or ceasing it is what it is if you can really see that you will not be attached to any of

95
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:59,580
the sensory awareness such as sight or sound you will cut off all idle thinking and forever

96
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:07,500
extinguish discursive thoughts that's when we reach the samadhi of stillness of the mind now

97
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:12,380
your mind is always at peace in stillness you actually

98
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:20,140
know everything so this is how we practice meditate on this that's how we change our destiny

99
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:27,580
so in order to change our destiny we need to change our mind change our mind from the fully

100
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:36,300
conceptualized nature to the fully accomplished nature by contemplation of everything as merely

101
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:42,540
my consciousness and reach the samadhi of stillness of form or direction

102
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:50,460
directly contemplate on the suchness and reach the samadhi of stillness of the mind that's how we

103
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:58,860
transform from a mundane to a sane so that's a class for today thank you for listening amitabha
