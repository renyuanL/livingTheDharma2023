1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,760
Today we are going to talk about how the mind works.

2
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,360
The essence of our mind is called the original enlightenment.

3
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:28,120
It was free from all thoughts, but because it couldn't stand still, it started moving

4
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:33,840
and being agitated. It became the deluded mind, so we call it non-enlightenment.

5
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:41,120
Learning Buddhism is a process of actualization of enlightenment back to the perfect stillness

6
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,520
and finally reach final enlightenment, becoming a Buddha, reaching Buddhahood.

7
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,840
So today we are going to talk about how the mind works from the unenlightened state to

8
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,600
the enlightened state.

9
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,680
Every thought goes through 9 aspects, 3 subtle aspects and 6 cruel aspects.

10
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:08,440
Let's first talk about the 3 subtle aspects. This happens in our alaya consciousness, which

11
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:15,600
is our storehouse that stores all the karmic seeds of our past actions ready to be ripened

12
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,040
and produce the external world.

13
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,680
So let's look at the 3 aspects.

14
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,280
First is activity of ignorance.

15
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,740
It was the perfect still-suchness, but it got bored. It started having activities.

16
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:34,300
That means it started having thoughts. We call it this activity of ignorance.

17
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:40,000
Why do we call it ignorance? Because we are ignorant and we don't know that we have the

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,800
perfect self that is pure, eternal and that is self-sufficient. So we forgot about it

19
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,520
and we started having thoughts.

20
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,360
Number 2, it would produce perceiving subject.

21
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,360
Number 2, it would produce perceiving subject.

22
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:52,940
Number 1, it would produce perceiving subject.

23
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:53,240
Number 2, it would produce perceiving subject.

24
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:59,380
consciousness produces the seventh consciousness and the seventh consciousness grabs onto the

25
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:06,720
eighth consciousness as its permanent self. So we started having the idea of the personhood,

26
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:13,180
the ego, and we start perceiving the world based on our ego. So that's a perceiving subject.

27
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:21,300
We usually give the example of forced perceptions of water. Human, we see water as this liquid

28
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:28,520
that we can drink and use. Animals, such as fish, see the water as their habitat. And heavenly

29
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:36,180
beings, they see water as crystal. And all the ghosts, they see water as thick blood that's not

30
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,760
drinkable, even though they're very thirsty. So who is right? Who is seeing the right water?

31
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:49,720
Nobody, because it's all relative. It's based on perceiving subject of alaya consciences or

32
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,320
consciousness.

33
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:57,240
Number three, we will create the world of objects. So both the subject and the world

34
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:05,540
of objects is produced by our own alaya consciousness. Everything that you see in the external world

35
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:12,360
is actually all once imagined in our mind. So be careful what you think about. It will

36
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,100
manifest. For example, you might think of someone and the telephone ring and it will

37
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,000
be that person calling. Or you became a vegetarian.

38
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:26,120
You're thinking of vegetarian food and you spot a vegetarian restaurant around the corner.

39
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:33,080
Why is that? Because our thoughts produce reality. So think about things that's positive

40
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,960
and great. If you think about Amitabha Buddha, you will see Amitabha Buddha.

41
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:45,100
So we create the dreamer. We create the dream world, but we don't know it's a dream.

42
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:50,100
We have the six crew aspects of our thoughts that's happening in our spirit. So we create

43
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:56,380
the six consciousness, which is our mind. That does the thinking and analysis.

44
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:04,080
Number one, it will have discriminating intellect. It will discriminate this external object

45
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:10,080
as something we like or dislike. For example, we might like a lot of compliments and we

46
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:17,140
don't like any criticism. Or we like a lot of accomplishments, we don't like any failures.

47
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:20,280
Or we like prosperity and we don't like declines.

48
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:26,980
What do we base our likes and dislikes on? We base it on the idea of the self. We do

49
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:33,980
everything to protect the self and that's how we think and discriminate the world.

50
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:41,980
Number two is aspect of continuity. This discriminates the likes and dislikes, when after it continues,

51
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:48,180
it becomes a feeling of pleasure and pain. When we eat a chocolate cake, why do we like

52
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,180
it so much?

53
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,560
not that we like the taste of the chocolate cake it's because we like the

54
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:58,560
pleasure derived from tasting the chocolate cake that's the same as

55
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,960
alcohol or cigarette or any kind of thing that we're addicted to we're

56
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,360
addicted to the pleasurable feeling so that's because of the aspect of

57
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,100
continuity number three is an aspect of attachment as feeling of pleasure and

58
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:21,440
pain continued it will become attached will have even more attachment for

59
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,500
example if you really like your son you will attach everything to your son when

60
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,660
something happened to your son you would be depressed or worried a lot that will

61
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:36,640
affect your whole world or you bought a new car and someone made a scratch on it

62
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,740
and then you're heartbroken why because you've attachment the more attachment

63
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,000
you have the more suffering you have but we don't know that

64
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,080
you have the more suffering you have but we don't know that

65
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:51,680
number four is an aspect of speculation on names and letters we will analyze in

66
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,460
terms of words we will give it names in our mind for example we'll have names

67
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:02,900
based on what society gives us this is Louis Vuitton bag this is Rolex watch

68
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:08,660
this is a Porsche because of what the society tells us we have a lot of names

69
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:14,980
and letters in our mind we attach to our experience based on these brand names

70
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:20,600
and number five is an aspect of giving rise to karma after the strong

71
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,820
attachment with names will commit to an action for example something we

72
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:31,340
want we're gonna go search for it or with don't like someone we will have the

73
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:36,840
action of hitting the person or we might say something rude to revenge so these

74
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,320
are all things that we're going to commit

75
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:44,880
and it becomes a karma number six aspect of anxiety attached to the

76
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:52,940
aspect of karma. Because of karma, we will create anxiety. Anxiety here, it means suffering.

77
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:59,440
If you do a good deed, you will create karma in the three good realms, the heavenly realm,

78
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,880
the asura realm, and the human realm. If you create bad deeds, you will go to the three

79
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,540
bad realms, the animal realm, the ghost realm, and the hell realm. No matter what happens

80
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:17,480
to you, you are still creating karma in the six realms of reincarnation that never ends.

81
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:24,860
It's a vicious cycle and that's what we call delusion, karma, and suffering. That's what

82
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:32,800
we call samsara or life and death. So samsara or reincarnation is not caused by anyone.

83
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:40,100
It's caused by your own deluded thought, your deluded mind. So learning Buddhism is a process

84
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:40,520
of learning.

85
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:46,020
It's a process of liberating ourselves from this samsara life. So what do we do? First,

86
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:50,960
we have to recognize this nine aspects of the thought. It happens in an instant, but

87
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:57,340
it narrows down to four steps. The thought rising, the thought of binding, the thought

88
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:04,260
changing, and the thought ceasing. For example, sitting at home, bored, so I start thinking

89
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:10,080
about that person bad-mouthed me, how rude he is. So it's the thought rising, that's

90
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:16,980
my activity of ignorance. Then the thought of binding, me perceiving his words, and the

91
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:24,040
world object is his words. And then I will have discerning intellect, I dislike his words.

92
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:31,880
Aspect of continuity, feeling of pain from his words. And aspect of attachment, I will

93
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:37,300
keep thinking about it, I might not be able to sleep because of his words. And then have

94
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,060
aspect of speculation on names and elements.

95
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,700
What'sarsi Nopedi, how a person Durong and

96
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,800
Zanse be for the next?

97
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,400
Master Fengeding,

98
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:52,620
Oh, I

99
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,180
was

100
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:00,980
thinking a little bit bad about this position.

101
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:05,960
Master Fengending said the ultimate inner strength of specialists is when we collect

102
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,680
our

103
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,440
soul.

104
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,320
Master Fengending,

105
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:09,520
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

106
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:09,900
Master Fengending,

107
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:09,980
OK. Master Fengending and Zang Guixiang are both importantं this! Master Fengending,

108
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:17,600
or about to end when you commit the karma and have suffering so that's how every thought has

109
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:25,020
these four stages we want to recognize it as soon as we can the sooner you catch it the sooner you

110
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:31,900
stop it the more enlightened you are ordinary men like us we might not catch the thought until it's

111
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:38,600
kind of late we already create the karma and we already creating the anxiety for example i already

112
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:45,100
ate a chocolate cake then i realized oh it's not good for me i am creating greed and more samsara

113
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:52,600
so but that is already at the seizing the ending stage but for our arhat who is a theravada

114
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:59,500
self-enlightened saint they might catch their thoughts in this changing state for example

115
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:05,240
there was a monk he was studying with the master for many years and one day he decided to leave

116
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,440
the master and go on his own for years he started

117
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:08,580
building his own temple and he started building his own temple and he started building his own

118
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:08,600
temple and he started building his own temple and he started building his own temple and he started

119
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:14,840
building a majestic temple and had many disciples one day he heard that his master was coming to

120
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:20,840
visit him so he started cleaning up the whole place trying to impress his master and the night

121
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:28,200
before his master came he looked at his place and he thought oh my pride and my ego is at work

122
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,280
i'm so ashamed of myself so he grabbed a pile of sand

123
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:38,580
and spread it in front of the main hall of his temple the next day the master came looked around

124
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:45,060
the whole place and he said the most impressive thing in this whole place is the pile of sand in

125
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:52,740
front of the main hall so this monk he catch his thought with the attachment state when he is

126
00:10:52,740 --> 00:11:00,340
attached to his ego and to his pride and then bodhisattva who is the mahayana buddhism trying to

127
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:07,540
enlighten others they might catch their thoughts in the binding stage there was a monk he was a thief

128
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,560
before he became a monk he was a thief before he became a monk he was a thief before he became a monk

129
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:16,260
one day he was giving a dharma talk in front of a large audience and after the dharma talk there was

130
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:22,740
a lot of tin cans of tea leaves and he loves tea leaves so he thought to himself oh it'll be great

131
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:28,820
if i can bring these tea leaves home so i can enjoy them for a long time and then he realized

132
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:36,300
that was a thought of greediness obediently he shout out see thief he tried to stop his own

133
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,540
greediness so he is catching his own greediness and he is trying to stop his own greediness so he is catching

134
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:46,640
his discriminating intellect the first moment of likes and dislikes and greediness okay so if you

135
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:54,800
are bodhisattva you might be able to see your thoughts at an earlier stage and buddha sees the

136
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:01,680
thought and the rising stage he is completely enlightened so he doesn't even have the thought

137
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:08,320
arising basically his alaya consciousness is completely purified he has no more thoughts

138
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:14,920
so that's the final enlightenment that we're trying to reach so why do we meditate we meditate

139
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:22,440
to quiet our mind to be aware of our thoughts and to be able to stop our thoughts that's diluted

140
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:31,240
back to our pure immutable pure mind that's our goal so at the end you will realize the original

141
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:37,760
enlightenment is the process of actualization of enlightenment is the final enlightenment

142
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,460
because of the process of realization of enlightenment is the final enlightenment

143
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:38,520
because of the process of realization of enlightenment
