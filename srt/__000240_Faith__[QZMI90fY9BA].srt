1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,480
We're going to hold off on the 14 chapters of Buddhism for now because we have other important topics to discuss.

2
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,820
Today we'll be talking about faith.

3
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:28,240
How do we stay faithful when we're facing a lot of difficulties and disappointments in life?

4
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,960
First of all, we should know that faith is actually a great virtue. It's very wholesome.

5
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:38,200
On the other hand, if we have doubt, that's actually an affliction and it's unwholesome.

6
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,740
So always stay positive and faithful.

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,880
There was a village that was in drought for many years, so a local pastor decided to hold a prayer meeting to pray for rain.

8
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:52,420
During the prayer meeting, the pastor noticed there was a little girl in the front row.

9
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,700
She was actually holding an open umbrella over her head

10
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:00,460
because she knew that God was going to answer her prayers and it's going to rain.

11
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,500
So do we have the strong faith as this little girl?

12
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,300
In the Flower Adornment Sutra, it says,

13
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:14,700
Faith is the foundation of cultivating the Way and the Mother of Merit and Virtue because it is capable of nourishing good roots.

14
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:21,460
In the 100 Dharma Treatise, it talks about 11 wholesome dharmas and faith is one of them.

15
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:25,300
So faith is the basis of all goodness and all virtues.

16
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,860
So we need to have that in the very beginning.

17
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:34,060
Also in the other treaty, called the Great Treaty on Perfection of Wisdom, it says,

18
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:39,300
The Dharma is like a vast sea. Only by faith can it be entered.

19
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,540
Only by faith can we enter and benefit from the Dharma.

20
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:47,180
Just like if we are in front of a mountain of treasures.

21
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:52,700
If we have no hands, then we are incapable of taking any jewels out of the mountain.

22
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,460
The faith are our hands.

23
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:54,560
So if we have hands, then we are incapable of taking any jewels out of the mountain. The faith are our hands.

24
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,060
So if we have hands, then we are incapable of taking any jewels out of the mountain.

25
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:59,120
If we have hands, then we can benefit from the greatness of the Dharma.

26
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,400
So how do we have faith?

27
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,800
It's not blind faith.

28
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,900
Our faith is based on wisdom.

29
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,020
So let's learn how to have faith.

30
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,120
We need to have faith in three things.

31
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:13,400
Faith in the truth, have faith in virtues, and have faith in the capabilities.

32
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,720
With these three faiths, we need to develop three corresponding traits.

33
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,620
Believing in the truth, we need to develop deep endurance.

34
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,960
Believing in the virtues, we need to develop deep joy.

35
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,980
Believing in the virtues, we need to develop deep joy.

36
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:30,260
and believing in our capabilities we need to develop deep desire so let's

37
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:35,240
look at each one of them in detail first let's look at truth there's two kinds of

38
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,740
truth that we need to really believe in the first one is called conventional

39
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:44,540
truth and the second one is called ultimate truth the conventional truth is

40
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:49,820
about what's going on in the world which is called taxation so cause and effect

41
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:55,400
just like if we do good deeds we will get good results if we do bad deeds we will

42
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,960
have bad retribution that's the conventional truth we need to believe in

43
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:05,180
and the Ming Dynasty there was a merchant trading goods between the north

44
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:10,580
south of China he secretly added mercury to the weighing scale so he will make

45
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:15,560
more money so when he was dying he passed the scale to his son and tell him

46
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,980
to do business with the scale the son was a nobleman

47
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,800
so he burned the scale and sold the scale to his son and sold the scale to the

48
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,940
nobleman so he burned the scale instead and after he burned the scale both his

49
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:29,160
sons passed away suddenly so he thought there must be no karma I did a good deed

50
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,180
and this is what happened to me one night when he's dreaming the gods came

51
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:38,400
to him and told him your two sons they were in your family to destroy and

52
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,380
squander away all your family wealth but because you burned the scale we decided

53
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:48,060
to take them away and you will have two new sons they will be virtuous and good

54
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,740
for your family and sure enough the two sons decided to take them away and you will have two new sons they will be virtuous and good for your family and sure enough

55
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:55,500
the son had two new sons and they were virtuous and good for the family so if

56
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,980
we keep being good and believe in goodness will result in good karma then

57
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:05,740
we will have a good life after all so believe in the conventional truth of

58
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:11,040
causation on the other hand we need to believe in the ultimate truth ultimate

59
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,780
truth is not about what we see cause and effect

60
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:19,600
good or bad pure and impure it's about ultimate truth who is seeing everything

61
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,840
everything in its totality, so the oneness of things. The essence behind everything is

62
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:32,040
called the absolute reality, which is basically the one mind. The truth of the universe is

63
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:38,160
our one true mind, our Buddha nature. That is the center of the universe. So we need

64
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,480
to believe in the ultimate truth. When we are cultivating, trying to get rid of our

65
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:49,140
afflictions, we use the conventional truth. When we want to believe in ourselves and be

66
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:55,260
more positive and hopeful, we use the ultimate truth. Really rely on these two truths in

67
00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:01,260
order for us to practice and succeed in our cultivation. We need to develop deep endurance

68
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:07,460
about the truth. Really believe in them. Rely on the truth, and that's how we cultivate.

69
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:14,200
In 1977, there were two American Buddhist monks. They did a pilgrimage. It's called

70
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,640
Three Steps, One Bell. So they take three steps and do one bell.

71
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,140
They would do three steps and do one bell. They would do three steps and do one bell.

72
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:25,040
They went from Southern California and Pasadena all the way to Ukiah, California, which is

73
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:31,880
a distance of 800 miles. Carrying no money, no talking, a lot of difficulties and weather

74
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:38,300
and everything, but they did it for two and a half years every day. How do they do that?

75
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:44,020
Because they believe in the truth. They believe in their bowing will bring world peace. They

76
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:49,140
really believe in karma, and they believe in their Buddha nature. So that's how they

77
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:54,920
did it. We need to develop deep endurance, really accord with the truth.

78
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:01,520
Number two, we need to believe in Buddha's virtues. Virtues include the Triple Jewels.

79
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,260
We need to believe in the pure and the real virtues of Buddha, the pure and real virtue

80
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:12,920
of the Dharma, and the pure and the real virtue of the Sangha. We call it the Triple Jewels.

81
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:18,640
So we need to take refuge in the Triple Jewels. First of all, we need to believe in Buddha.

82
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:25,960
Buddha, he has a lot of virtues. We don't see Buddha right now. We only see Buddha statue.

83
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:32,980
But do you have faith in his greatness? For example, Amitabha, he made 48 vows in order

84
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:39,640
to create the wonderful pure land for us. Do you believe that his 48 vows actually have

85
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:44,760
power in this universe? And every time you chant his name, the power actually comes right

86
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,760
out?

87
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,640
Number 33 of his vow, it says,

88
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:55,960
Any being if be touched by the ray of splendor of my light should not make his body and mind

89
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:01,340
gentle and peaceful in such a state that is far more sublime than the heavenly beings,

90
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,220
then may I not attain enlightenment.

91
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:10,640
So anyone who chants his name will be in touch with Buddha's light. That will make us gentle

92
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:17,280
and peaceful and warm. All our doubt and our worries and all our negative karma and sins

93
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,280
will go away.

94
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,540
Our body and mind will be filled with Buddha's light and is warm.

95
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:28,240
So believe in Buddha's vows and believe in his virtues. That's what carries us through

96
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,740
all difficulties.

97
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:34,780
We need to believe in the Dharma. Dharma is Buddha's teachings. Do you really believe

98
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:42,640
in Buddha's dharma? For example, his precepts. Precepts are very valuable and very precious.

99
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:48,380
Only Buddha can set the precepts. Not Bodhisattva or anyone else can set any precepts.

100
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:54,340
so be definite and hold pure precepts for example if we have a lot of ants or

101
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:59,600
spiders or mosquito in the house it's very easy just to use pesticide and kill

102
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,440
them but if you really want to follow Buddha's teaching we need to make sure

103
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,680
we do not kill any insects or any sentient beings we love them and we

104
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:14,260
actually want to carry them out safely one by one if your friend asks you to go

105
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:19,020
and just have a quick drink you would say no because I really believe in

106
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:24,440
Buddha's teaching I'm disciplined and I want to do all that is good and virtuous

107
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:29,700
so you should hold to the virtue of the Buddha and the Dharma and follow it

108
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:34,340
accordingly lastly we should believe in the virtues of the Sangha sangha is the

109
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:38,320
Buddhist community they're all these monks who devote their whole life in

110
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,320
practicing Buddhism they are our role models right now we don't see any Buddha

111
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:43,520
but we should see Buddha for a long time.

112
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:50,560
the monks as Buddha, being as reverent and respectful as we can. Many kalpas ago, there

113
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,880
was a devoted practitioner, his name was Ru Tong. At that time, there was a Buddha named

114
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:01,000
Meditating Light Buddha. The Buddha was coming to his country, so everybody in the country,

115
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,280
they were busy decorating for the Buddha. Finally, the Buddha arrived. As he was walking

116
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:11,700
on the street, everybody was in awe of Buddha's presence. Unfortunately, there was a puddle

117
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:16,940
of sludge right in front of Buddha. Ru Tong saw it. He immediately unwrapped his hair,

118
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:22,020
laid his long hair on the ground so Buddha can walk over the sludge without getting his

119
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:29,260
feet dirty. Buddha noticed his deep sincerity and made a prediction. In 91 kalpas, you will

120
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:35,080
become a Buddha. Your name will be Shakyamuni and your world will be called the Sokka world.

121
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:41,660
So Ru Tong was actually one lifetime of Shakyamuni Buddha. So we need to be respectful to all

122
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:41,680
of us.

123
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:52,200
At the end, we should have deep joy in our practice. We should love to practice Buddhism.

124
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:57,340
We should have fun in our practice. The more fun we have, the more we accumulate great

125
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:02,780
merits. Don't feel like it's so hard and I really don't enjoy it. I just make myself

126
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:08,060
do the meditation. No, you should love everything. You should love going to the temple, love

127
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,660
to make offerings to monks, love to meditate, love to listen to the Buddha. You should love

128
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:16,740
to listen to Dharma. The more you like it, the more you will succeed. There's a pianist

129
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:21,640
named Uma Garrett. She started playing the piano when she was only four years old. This

130
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:26,800
little girl loved to play the piano. The moment she wakes up, she wants to play and she wants

131
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,740
to play all the way till the middle of the night. So her mom had to give her curfews.

132
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:34,960
You cannot wake up too early to play. You're going to wake up the neighbors and you cannot

133
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:40,120
play too late till night because you're going to disturb everybody. If we love to meditate,

134
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,620
love to practice, us Buddhists, we should love to practice. We should love to practice.

135
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:47,380
As much as Uma loves to play the piano, then we'll definitely succeed in our cultivation.

136
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:55,060
Lastly, we need to believe in our own capabilities. We are capable and we have the power to have

137
00:10:55,060 --> 00:11:01,420
good karma. If we keep practicing, we'll definitely accumulate good karma. There's no way the

138
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:06,880
more we practice, the worse our life gets. That's just impossible. So have faith that

139
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,580
you are accumulating much good merit and good karma when you're practicing Buddhism.

140
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:18,140
And also, we need to believe we'll definitely reach Buddhahood one day. It's sooner or later.

141
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:23,380
The harder we practice, the sooner we will become a Buddha. So have faith in your own

142
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:29,700
ability and your Buddha nature. We already have it inside of us. We just need to undiscover

143
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:36,500
it by our cultivation. When Shakyamuni Buddha was alive, he had a disciple named Mahanama.

144
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:41,460
One day, Mahanama asked Shakyamuni Buddha, Buddha, this world is so chaotic. I don't know

145
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:47,380
what to do. I'm afraid one day I will lose my focus in the Buddha, Dharma, and the Sangha.

146
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:53,020
Where will I go after that? Buddha asked him, if a big tree falls, what direction would

147
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:59,380
it lean toward? Mahanama answered, it will lean toward the heavier side where many branches

148
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:06,260
grow. Buddha said, so will you. When you're alive, you've been holding pure precepts,

149
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:11,220
you've been practicing giving, you've been listening to the Dharma, and you've been contemplating

150
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:15,900
the profound meanings of the Dharma with all these virtues and good deeds. When you're

151
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:22,460
about to pass, your consciousness will definitely go to a place of pure peace and joy. And you'll

152
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:28,840
definitely be reborn in the heavenly realm or the Buddha world, the pure land. So Mahanama

153
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:34,860
was very happy after hearing Buddha's teaching. So we need to believe in our own cultivation.

154
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:40,620
We'll definitely succeed. So don't have any worries. And we should have deep desire, really

155
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,300
want to achieve.

156
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:46,980
We want to accomplish in our cultivation. Some people, this lifetime, want to be a millionaire.

157
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:53,460
Some people want to win the Olympics or want to be a movie star or want to be a Nobel Prize

158
00:12:53,460 --> 00:13:01,560
winner. But we want to have the selfless desire of becoming a Buddha because we want to really

159
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:07,700
end the samsara. We want to let everybody be out of the suffering. That's a selfless

160
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,900
desire, selfless goal.

161
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,900
So be firm in your cultivation.

162
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:18,840
Your desire to cultivate. In the end, the conclusion is a pure mind of faith emerges

163
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,080
real mark.

164
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:26,180
When we have no more doubt about Buddha, no more doubt about ourselves, and no more doubt

165
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:33,540
about everyone else, when our mind is pure without confusion, the real mark emerges.

166
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:41,340
Real mark is the ultimate truth, which is the absolute reality, our Buddha nature, the

167
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,780
one mind.

168
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:47,360
We will become enlightened because our true self will emerge.

169
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,940
So believe that your faith will help you succeed and become enlightened.

170
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:58,220
We don't want to be like a feather that is flowing in the air without direction.

171
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:04,140
Our faith should be strong as a rock and this lifetime we will succeed in our cultivation.

172
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,960
So thank you for listening. Amitabha.
