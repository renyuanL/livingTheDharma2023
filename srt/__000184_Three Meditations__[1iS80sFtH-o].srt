00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Today we are going to talk about three meditations.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This follows the last two classes.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Today is an overall summary.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So it might be a little bit more detailed, a little bit harder.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Today there are five sets of three.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Three truths, three solutions, three meditations, three wisdoms, and three virtues.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So if you understand the system of cultivation,

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
you know the entire truth about the universe and how we can cultivate into Buddhahood.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
First we come to understand the three truths of the universe.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The first truth is called the ultimate truth.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Like we said before, it's a truth about emptiness.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Everything is based on cause and conditions.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Cause and conditions are forever changing.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So nothing is permanent in our lives.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This body is going to get old, it's going to die.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's not permanent. We just use it.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So in its essence, it's empty in nature.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
That's what we call the ultimate truth.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
If you understand this, then you will not be attached to this body

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
or to whatever that's happening to you in this lifetime.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And you will have peace and happiness.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So let go of all attachment and the idea of the ego and the me.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The second truth is called the conventional truth.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Everything is empty in its essence, but it has its physical appearance and forms.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We cannot deny it temporarily exists.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We have to eat, we have to sleep, we have to make money.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We are still on this earth and doing conventional life.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So even though it's empty, we'll be the best that we can be

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
and lead a great life and become compassionate and help all people.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So that's the conventional truth.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The third truth is called the middle way.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The middle way truth is a balance of the emptiness and the conventional truth.

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's an enlightenment of your own Buddha nature.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
When you're over here, you're very well-rounded.

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You will understand the meaning of equanimity.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You treat everybody the same because we're all empty in essence.

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
We're all together as one.

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
We're all the Buddha nature.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So that's when you're truly enlightened, when you know the middle way.

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Originally, we're all Buddha, but we deluded ourselves.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We have three delusions that clouded our minds.

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
That's why we are like this now.

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
We've become a mundane person.

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The first delusion is called false perception, subjective thinking.

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Our perceptions are seeing the world

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
with our own lenses.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
We see the world based on our own ego and our perception of things.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
There's this mom, one day she went to see the older son.

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
He was holding a book and sleeping.

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The mom's like, he's so lazy.

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Every time he studies, he falls asleep.

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So he doesn't like the older son.

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And then he went to the younger son's room.

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The younger son is also holding a book and sleeping.

55
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
She loves the younger son.

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
He said, oh, he studies so hard.

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Even when he's sleeping, he's trying to study.

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So she saw two of the same thing,

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
but she got two different conclusions.

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Because we're full of ourselves and we have our way of seeing things.

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But what is the truth?

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You have never seen the reality of things

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
because you're seeing through your own ego.

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So that's why we call it the false perception.

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's a subjective thinking.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That clouds us from seeing the ultimate truth.

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The second kind of delusion is called the subtle and coarse illusion.

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
We have very refined delusions,

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
as numerous as the dust and the sand.

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
We have so much misjudgment and discrimination about everything.

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
This is coming from selfishness or selfish thoughts.

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
This doesn't have to be the selfishness.

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's about the truth.

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's about over all misjudgment and discrimination.

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
There was a monk.

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
He's been in the mountain meditating inside a cave for many, many years.

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Monkeys bring him fruits for him to eat.

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So they actually help him survive.

79
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Every day he would just eat one fruit that the monkey brings.

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
After years of cultivation, he finally come back to the monastery.

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
One day someone came and gave offering to the monk,

82
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
very precious peaches.

83
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The monk said,

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Oh, can you bring these peaches to the monkeys?

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And his disciples were like,

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Isn't that kind of wasteful?

87
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
They're very, very precious.

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The monk said,

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So giving it to you is not wasteful?

90
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Why do you think giving it to the monkey is wasteful?

91
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Because that's our own perception,

92
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
our subtle and coarse illusion.

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
We have our own thinking.

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We think, you know, giving to human is not wasteful.

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Giving to a monkey is wasteful.

96
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
We have a lot of delusions.

97
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
We just don't know.

98
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
We never realize that.

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So that clouds us so we don't see the conventional truth.

100
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The third kind of delusion is called ignorance.

101
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
All our wandering thoughts are ignorance.

102
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
All your thoughts, no matter it's good or bad,

103
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
is all wandering thoughts.

104
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
When you are not fully mindful of the present moment,

105
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
you are not awakened.

106
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You are still ignorant.

107
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
This clouds us from seeing the middle way truth.

108
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Okay, we are like this now.

109
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What do we have to do?

110
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
We have to practice the three meditations.

111
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
That will help you see the truth again.

112
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
First, we practice the void meditation.

113
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Void meditation is seeing the nothingness,

114
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
seeing the emptiness.

115
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Just like when we're meditating,

116
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
you know, you're seeing the field and your body disappears.

117
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
That is to help you see what is the world like

118
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
when I don't have the ego.

119
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It actually gives you a great freedom

120
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
that you don't have to have the idea of the self.

121
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
For example, if someone insults you,

122
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
this is emptiness.

123
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
There's not a me being insulted

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
and there's not this person insulting me

125
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
because the idea of me is all empty.

126
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
This is a great way of meditating.

127
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And the second kind of meditation

128
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
is called the unreal meditation.

129
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Everything is empty

130
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
but it has its unreal temporary existence.

131
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's not real because it's temporary.

132
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
When you're acting, you're playing a movie,

133
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
you want to play a great movie.

134
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You don't want to play a movie that nobody wants to see.

135
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
In this world, we still go with the flow,

136
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
go with what the world says.

137
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
For example, is there Santa Claus?

138
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
We don't tell kids.

139
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's fake, right?

140
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
We still give gifts.

141
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
We still put gifts under the tree.

142
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
We know it's not real

143
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
but we still go with it

144
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
because we want to make everyone happy.

145
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
When you come to this kind of unreal meditation

146
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
and you will come to the conventional truth,

147
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
you will love everybody in your life

148
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
without any attachment to them or to yourself.

149
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
That is a great wisdom

150
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
when you can practice unreal meditation.

151
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And the last meditation

152
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
is called the Ming meditation.

153
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Ming, again, is the balance of the emptiness

154
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
and whatever appears right now,

155
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
the temporary existence.

156
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You want to go with the world,

157
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
go with the flow,

158
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
enjoy the party,

159
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
but you don't have the idea of Ming.

160
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You don't have all these subjective thinking and emotion.

161
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That way, you will understand the truth of the middle way.

162
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
When you practice the three kinds of meditation,

163
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
you will come to the three wisdoms.

164
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So this is the result.

165
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The three wisdoms and the three virtues

166
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
are the result of your cultivation.

167
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You will come to the general and all-knowledge wisdom.

168
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
When we get rid of our false perception

169
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
and subjective thinking

170
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
by practicing the void meditation,

171
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
we come to the general and all-knowledge wisdom.

172
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Knowing the ultimate truth

173
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
and develop the virtue of prajna.

174
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Prajna means insight.

175
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
True insight is when you understand emptiness.

176
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That's a virtue we gain and develop.

177
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
The second wisdom you will gain

178
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
is called the differentiation wisdom.

179
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You will know all the conventional truths,

180
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
but you differentiate without judgment

181
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
and discrimination

182
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
because you don't have yourself involved

183
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
and you are able to love everyone.

184
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Some people like to eat noodles.

185
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Some people like to eat buns.

186
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Some people like to eat rice.

187
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Everybody is different,

188
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
but you can go with everybody

189
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
because you know the conventional truth.

190
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
That's a real wisdom

191
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
when you can get along with everyone,

192
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
hang out with anybody,

193
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
survive in all situations,

194
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
and you are still enlightened person,

195
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
compassionate and help everybody.

196
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And you will gain

197
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
the deliverance virtue.

198
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
This is a freedom from your subtle and coarse illusion.

199
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You're free from all the judgment

200
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
that's clouding your mind.

201
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And you will see the conventional truth.

202
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And lastly,

203
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
when you do the Ming meditation

204
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
and get rid of your ignorance,

205
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
you will gain the overall and perfect wisdom.

206
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You are now one with the universe.

207
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You are actually able to

208
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
love everyone

209
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
and have no problem in your life.

210
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
This time you become real Buddha.

211
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And you gain the Dharmakaya.

212
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Dharmakaya means your Buddha nature.

213
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You are not the physical body anymore.

214
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You are the spiritual body.

215
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You are awakened

216
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
and you are fully enlightened.

217
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
That's when we become a real Buddha.

218
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So just want to let you know

219
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
this actually is what we have

220
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
innately.

221
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's not someone giving it to you.

222
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's what you have originally.

223
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So have confidence in yourself

224
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
that we're all Buddhas to begin with.

225
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What's actually not real?

226
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
The three delusions are not real.

227
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You just gain it along the way

228
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
when you keep living in this world

229
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
and you become deluded.

230
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
But they are not real.

231
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The real you is you have the three wisdoms

232
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
and you have the three virtues.

233
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
When you go to a temple,

234
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
usually you will see three doors.

235
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
There are usually three arches.

236
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And what do three arches mean?

237
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It means the void meditation,

238
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
the unreal meditation,

239
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
and the mean meditation

240
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
because that's the gist of our cultivation.

241
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Okay, so that's the class for today.

242
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Thank you for listening.

243
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Amitabha.
