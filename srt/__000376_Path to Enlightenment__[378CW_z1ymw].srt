1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,800
Today we are going to talk about Path to Enlightenment.

2
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:25,600
Shakyamuni Buddha became enlightened by understanding the Four Noble Truths.

3
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:32,200
Today we are going to delve deep into Four Noble Truths to understand what is enlightenment.

4
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,200
The first one is suffering.

5
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:41,800
Right now we are suffering because we are in samsara, which means reincarnation.

6
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:47,800
As long as we are reincarnating, we are under tremendous suffering.

7
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,400
What is the cause of our suffering?

8
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,800
That's the second Noble Truth.

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,800
The cause of our suffering is our afflictions.

10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,900
Because we have afflictions, that's why we are reincarnating.

11
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,700
If we don't have afflictions, then we will be out of samsara.

12
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,700
So the key is to get rid of our afflictions.

13
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,200
How do we do that?

14
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,200
We need to practice the path to end suffering.

15
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,200
We call it Bodhi.

16
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,100
Bodhi means way to enlightenment.

17
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,100
Usually it's the three aspects of learning.

18
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,900
Precepts, concentration and wisdom.

19
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:36,300
We practice these three things that are Bodhi so we can reach cessation of suffering.

20
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,100
That's what we call Nirvana.

21
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,400
Nirvana is not death.

22
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,300
It means when we have no more afflictions.

23
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:49,100
When we have no more self, no more afflictions, that is the ultimate happiness.

24
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:49,900
When we have no more self, no more afflictions, that is the ultimate happiness.

25
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,500
When we have no more self, no more afflictions, that is the ultimate happiness.

26
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,500
When we have no more self, no more afflictions, that is the ultimate happiness.

27
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,500
I further summarize these four.

28
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,500
Samsara means our five aggregates.

29
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,500
Our body and mind.

30
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:05,500
We are suffering right now because we have the five aggregates.

31
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,500
Our form, which is our body.

32
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:15,500
Our feelings, perception, mental formation and consciousness.

33
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,500
The first one is our body.

34
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,300
The next four is our mind.

35
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,300
The next four is our mind.

36
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,300
So body and mind.

37
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,300
We are attached to our body and mind.

38
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,300
We think that is me.

39
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,300
We have a perception of the self.

40
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,300
That is why we are in Samsara.

41
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:44,300
Buddha wants us to contemplate on the four mindfulness about the five aggregates.

42
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:48,300
Our body, our form is impure.

43
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:58,300
Every day trying to decorate this body and make it healthy and perfect or have sexual desires about other people's body.

44
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:06,300
If we can see how impure everyone's body is, you will love your body so much and we will get rid of the self.

45
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,300
Then our feelings.

46
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,300
We have to contemplate that it is only suffering.

47
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:17,300
We think we can gain happiness when our worldly desires are fulfilled.

48
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:21,300
For example, we have great food.

49
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,300
We go traveling, have great fun.

50
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,300
We think this feeling is happiness.

51
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:33,300
But any happiness we feel right now eventually is suffering.

52
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:39,300
Because when the happiness subsides, it always becomes suffering.

53
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:44,300
There is no way you can be out of suffering as long as you have a self.

54
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,300
So we have to contemplate.

55
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:54,300
Feelings will always end up as suffering as long as we are in Samsara.

56
00:03:54,300 --> 00:04:00,300
Our perception and our mental formation, that is our mind.

57
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:04,300
We have to know our mind is impermanent.

58
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:09,300
Right now, we believe this mind of ours is permanent.

59
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:15,300
My opinion, my thoughts, my views, this is the real me.

60
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,300
But there is no me.

61
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,300
Your thoughts are constantly changing.

62
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,300
Your emotions from day and night are completely different all the time.

63
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,300
How can you believe there is a permanent self?

64
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,300
It's not stable.

65
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:34,300
It's always changing due to cause and conditions and effects.

66
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,300
So the mind is impermanent.

67
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,300
Lastly, the consciousness.

68
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,300
The whole world, we call it Dharma, which means everything.

69
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,300
It is non-self.

70
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:52,300
We think everything has eternal, independent, controlling self,

71
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,300
which is a false view.

72
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:01,300
When we believe our body is clean, our feeling is happy,

73
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:07,300
our mind is permanent, our consciousness is self,

74
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:13,300
that is what we call upside-down view, false views.

75
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:18,300
So we need to contemplate on the fact that it's impure, suffering,

76
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,300
impermanent, and non-self.

77
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,300
So how do we do that?

78
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:27,300
First, we need to understand what is our afflictions.

79
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,300
Let's look at the second noble truth.

80
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,300
What is our afflictions?

81
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:37,300
Basically, it's our wrong views and wrong thoughts.

82
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,300
If you can get rid of our wrong views and wrong thoughts,

83
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,300
you have no more afflictions.

84
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,300
Then it's Nirvana.

85
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,300
There are five basic wrong views.

86
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,300
The first one is the view of the self.

87
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,300
We believe the body is me.

88
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,300
That is the biggest wrong view

89
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:01,300
because we think this is me and we are separate from others.

90
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,300
That's why we dislike others.

91
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,300
We are selfish.

92
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,300
We protect our body, protect this image

93
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,300
because we have a strong sense of self.

94
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:17,300
So we have to see that we have the wrong view of the self.

95
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,300
The second one is the one-sided view.

96
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,300
One-sided means either we believe in emptiness

97
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,300
or we believe in existence.

98
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,300
Some people believe in emptiness,

99
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:37,300
which means when we die, it's like a candle that's blown out.

100
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,300
That's all.

101
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,300
That is people that dwell on emptiness.

102
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,300
Some people dwell on existence.

103
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,300
They believe human will be human next lifetime

104
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,300
and human next lifetime.

105
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,300
Forever you'll be human.

106
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,300
That is people that believe in existence.

107
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,300
But both of these views are incorrect.

108
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,300
They are only one-sided.

109
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,300
It's not the middle way.

110
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:09,300
The middle way is not emptiness or existence.

111
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,300
It's this balance of emptiness and existence.

112
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:19,300
Number three, some people hold unbeneficial precepts.

113
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:26,300
For example, there are people that hold dog precepts or cow precepts.

114
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,300
They will behave like a cow or a dog

115
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,300
because they saw in their meditation

116
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,300
a cow or a dog went to heaven.

117
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,300
They don't know what's the right cause.

118
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,300
They believe it's because they act like a dog or a cow.

119
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,300
So they will start eating grass

120
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,300
or they will bark like a dog their whole life.

121
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,300
That's the precept they hold.

122
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,300
But that is totally the wrong cause to enlightenment.

123
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,300
They don't know what's the real precept.

124
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,300
They think that's the way to enlightenment.

125
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:04,300
The fourth wrong view is our attachment to views.

126
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,300
This is the wrong precepts.

127
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,300
Not knowing the right cause.

128
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:14,300
Wrong attachment to views is not knowing the correct effect or retribution.

129
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,300
Some people they have not reached enlightenment.

130
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,300
But they believe because they have deep meditation

131
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:26,300
they are arhat, which is their attachment to the wrong views.

132
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,300
Thinking their meditation is already enlightenment.

133
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,300
It's already arhatship.

134
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,300
The fifth one is deviant views.

135
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,300
Evil views.

136
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,300
Doing bad deeds.

137
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,300
Is good.

138
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,300
So you have the wrong views.

139
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,300
Because we have the view of the self,

140
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,300
that's why we have the next four.

141
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,300
Because of this wrong view,

142
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,300
we also have wrong thoughts.

143
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,300
The five primary afflictions.

144
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,300
We are greedy because we are selfish.

145
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,300
We always want to gain for ourselves.

146
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,300
It can be money.

147
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,300
It can be relationship.

148
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,300
It can be fame.

149
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,300
Food or sleep.

150
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,300
Greedy for these five desires.

151
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:17,300
We are very angry when we don't get our desires met.

152
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:21,300
We resent the obstacles from getting what we want.

153
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,300
When things don't go our way, we are upset.

154
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,300
That's our anger.

155
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,300
We are also very ignorant.

156
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:34,300
The fact that we think we have a self that's separate from others.

157
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,300
That's our biggest ignorance.

158
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,300
We don't understand there is no self.

159
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,300
Then we have arrogance.

160
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,300
We think we are superior than others.

161
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,300
It can be our appearance, wealth, or education.

162
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:54,300
You think you are so much higher than others

163
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,300
because we have a strong self.

164
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,300
Lastly, we have doubt.

165
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,300
We doubt ourselves.

166
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,300
We don't think enlightenment is possible.

167
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,300
We doubt the Dharma.

168
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:13,300
We don't believe practicing the Dharma will help us get into enlightenment.

169
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,300
And we doubt our teacher.

170
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,300
We think the teacher, they are not cultivating well.

171
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,300
I don't need to listen to the teacher.

172
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,300
We doubt these three things.

173
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,300
That's why we cannot succeed in our cultivation.

174
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,300
Because we have wrong views and we have wrong thoughts.

175
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,300
That's why we are in samsara.

176
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,300
And our five aggregates are suffering.

177
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,300
So what do we do now as a Buddhist?

178
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,300
What can we do to leave the suffering?

179
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:49,300
To get rid of our reincarnation?

180
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,300
Buddha says we need to practice.

181
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,300
Both Mahayana and Dravata,

182
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:59,300
we practice the Eightfold Path.

183
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,300
The only right path.

184
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,300
You can get rid of your afflictions.

185
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,300
First is right view.

186
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,300
Instead of wrong views,

187
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,300
you must build up right views.

188
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,300
How do we build up right views?

189
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,300
You need to understand the Four Noble Truths.

190
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,300
That is the right view.

191
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,300
If you don't understand why you are suffering,

192
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,300
how you can get out of suffering,

193
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,300
how are you supposed to solve any problem

194
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,300
or become enlightened?

195
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,300
So first, you have to understand the Four Noble Truths.

196
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,300
And you gotta get rid of the idea of the self.

197
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,300
So first, we must have right view.

198
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,300
Then, we must have right intentions.

199
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,300
Your thoughts.

200
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,300
You must get rid of your wrong thoughts.

201
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,300
Right intentions is without greed.

202
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,300
No greed, no anger, no ignorance.

203
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:55,300
That's our right thoughts, right intentions.

204
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,300
We have to get rid of our wrong speech.

205
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,300
For example, no lying,

206
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,300
no foul language, no gossiping,

207
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,300
and no slandering of others.

208
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,300
We must speak right speech.

209
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,300
We also have right action.

210
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,300
No killing, no stealing,

211
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,300
no sexual misconduct.

212
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:22,300
So with our mind, our mouth, our body,

213
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,300
we have to act accordingly.

214
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,300
If your body, mind, and speech are not proper,

215
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,300
how are you going to become enlightened?

216
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,300
Five, right livelihood.

217
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,300
You need to have a right job,

218
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,300
right career.

219
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,300
You cannot be selling drugs,

220
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,300
selling your body.

221
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,300
You cannot be doing unlawful things.

222
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,300
We do not want to hurt any living being.

223
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:54,300
Because we know we are all reincarnating together.

224
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,300
How can you hurt other beings?

225
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:00,300
So have the right way of living.

226
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:06,300
So you are not accumulating negative karma by your job.

227
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,300
Six, we must have right effort.

228
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,300
You need to be diligent in your practice,

229
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,300
in getting rid of afflictions.

230
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:19,300
Our only job is to awaken to our true nature

231
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:24,300
and to get rid of our wrong views and wrong thoughts.

232
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,300
Because that's the only way to get rid of the cause of suffering.

233
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:34,300
So put our mind and all our power into our practice.

234
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:38,300
Get rid of our evil and cultivate goodness.

235
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,300
Seven, right mindfulness.

236
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,300
Basically, these four.

237
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,300
Be mindful.

238
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,300
The body is impure.

239
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,300
Feelings is suffering.

240
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,300
Mind is impermanent.

241
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,300
All dharmas are non-self.

242
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,300
Lastly, right concentration.

243
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:03,300
Concentration is when you are mindful all the time.

244
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:08,300
You go into a deep meditation in terms of your wisdom

245
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,300
in your four mindfulness.

246
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,300
You can hold with the four mindfulness all the time.

247
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,300
Then you are totally focused in the dharma.

248
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,300
So we need to practice the Eightfold Path

249
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:27,300
in order to reach the cessation of suffering.

250
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,300
Nobody wants suffering.

251
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,300
Everyone wants to be happy.

252
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,300
Wants to reach nirvana.

253
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,300
Wants to see our true nature.

254
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,300
The suchness, the Buddha nature.

255
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,300
We need to practice these in order to get here.

256
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,300
We should know from all the Mahayana Buddhism

257
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,300
is telling us one important truth

258
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:55,300
which is the suchness, the nirvana

259
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,300
is already here.

260
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,300
Right here and right now.

261
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,300
In your one mind.

262
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,300
Because you are originally enlightened.

263
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,300
You don't need to practice so hard.

264
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,300
It's already within you.

265
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,300
You have the Buddha nature already.

266
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:19,300
So you will realize the four virtues of nirvana

267
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:26,300
which are permanence, bliss, self and purity.

268
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,300
They are the opposite of the four mindfulness.

269
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,300
Why is that?

270
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:37,300
Because before we have the upside down views.

271
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,300
Right now these are the truth.

272
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,300
They are aligned with their suchness.

273
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,300
You have the Buddha nature that is permanent.

274
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,300
Your Buddha nature is the same.

275
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,300
No matter which realm you are in.

276
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,300
And we have full blissfulness.

277
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,300
Bliss is our true nature.

278
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,300
We are always happy.

279
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,300
It's not coming from greed for worldly things.

280
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,300
It's from our internal happiness.

281
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,300
Our innate nature.

282
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,300
We are supposed to be happy all the time.

283
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,300
We have the self.

284
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:14,300
It's not the self we perceive as the five aggregates.

285
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,300
It's already the true suchness.

286
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,300
Our Buddha self.

287
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,300
That's our higher self.

288
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,300
The true self.

289
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,300
Lastly,

290
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,300
Self is always pure.

291
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,300
It's perfectly pure which means no afflictions.

292
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:34,300
All our afflictions are only illusion.

293
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,300
They don't really exist.

294
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:41,300
You can completely be awakened out of your afflictions

295
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,300
in one minute, in one instant.

296
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:48,300
Because you realize who you really are.

297
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,300
The true suchness.

298
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,300
In Mahayana Buddhism,

299
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:56,300
we know samsara is nirvana.

300
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,300
Affliction is bodhi.

301
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:05,300
There's no difference between samsara or nirvana.

302
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:10,300
There's no difference between affliction or bodhi.

303
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,300
Why?

304
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:15,300
Because we already have the Buddha nature.

305
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:21,300
As long as you let go of your attachment to all the worldly forms,

306
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,300
understand everything is only illusion,

307
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,300
happening in a dream,

308
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,300
let go of the self,

309
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,300
you are already your true Buddha nature.

310
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,300
Tragama Sutra.

311
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,300
It says,

312
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:38,300
When madness ceases, bodhi appears.

313
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,300
What is the madness?

314
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:47,300
The madness is our deluded mind having these illusions.

315
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,300
It sees this illusional self.

316
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:55,300
And go back to our true nature.

317
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,300
Then the bodhi naturally appears.

318
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,300
You are just who you are already.

319
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:05,300
The path to enlightenment

320
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:10,300
is to understand the truth of the world,

321
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,300
which is the Four Noble Truths.

322
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,300
So that's the class for today.

323
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,300
Thank you for listening.

324
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,300
Amitabha.
