1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,980
We are going to talk about mind as a skillful artist.

2
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,080
We are the artists that paint our own life and our own world.

3
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,080
This is from chapter 20 of the Amatāsaka Sutra.

4
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,520
Like a painter who spreads different colors, the presentation will vary in their forms,

5
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,560
yet the elemental seeds remain the same.

6
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:40,320
We are the artists that have different colors to paint different kinds of pictures, but

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,580
the elemental seed, which is our true nature, that's our Buddha nature, that is exactly

8
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,580
the same.

9
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,180
The different colors, it means karma.

10
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:55,700
We have wholesome thoughts, then we create good karma, then we have positive results

11
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,700
and we have good fortune.

12
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:03,060
And prosperity, when we have wholesome thoughts, then we create negative karma, then we have

13
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,320
calamities and disasters.

14
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:11,060
It's all from our creation of our mind, so that means a different color, but our Buddha

15
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,060
nature remains the same.

16
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:18,460
There are no forms to be found in the seeds and no seeds to be found in the forms, but

17
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,660
without the seeds, the form cannot be obtained.

18
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:26,140
So there are no forms, which means no painting, to be found in the mind.

19
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,900
And there's no mind to be found in the painting.

20
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,500
When you see a painting, you do not see the mind that created the painting.

21
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,880
And when you look into my mind, you do not see what I'm creating.

22
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,900
This means form is emptiness, that means all forms are illusory, everything is illusion.

23
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,820
So when conditions are favorable, do not give in to greed.

24
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,900
When the conditions are unfavorable, do not give in to afflictions.

25
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,140
Dale Carnegie talks about Edith and the painting.

26
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,140
The painting is a painting.

27
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,140
The painting is a painting.

28
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,920
Uncle Frank, they lived in a very poor farm, but

29
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,860
Aunt Edith likes to buy curtains and goodies to decorate her home on credit from a store

30
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,080
in the city.

31
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,860
Uncle Frank is afraid of running up bills, so he went to the store owner and told him

32
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,900
not to let his wife buy on credit.

33
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:22,500
When Aunt Edith found out, she was furious, and for the next 50 years she talked about

34
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,940
it every day.

35
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,620
That was the voice on her mind.

36
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:33,260
She did not paint a very good life for herself because of her attachment and her delusion.

37
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:38,760
The forms or the painting, that means the conventional truth, the phenomenon.

38
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,720
The seeds or the mind, it means the ultimate truth, the noumenon.

39
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,240
Both are empty in essence.

40
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:51,380
Never abiding is the mind, immeasurable and inconceivable.

41
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:56,660
It manifests all the forms, each unaware of each other's existence.

42
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:01,380
Our mind is never abiding, which means it's constantly changing.

43
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,100
Every thought actually creates the world.

44
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:10,120
The vast emptiness thumb around is created by our mind, but we do not know that.

45
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:16,460
And we do not know each other's alaya consciousness that is creating what we are experiencing

46
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,180
in this world right now.

47
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,360
All the phenomenon is created by our alaya consciousness.

48
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,160
The best analogy is cartoon animation.

49
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:32,240
Each second is made out of 24 frames of picture put together in a contained sequence.

50
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,580
Because it moves along extremely fast, it makes the cartoon come alive.

51
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,940
Our alaya consciousness is the same.

52
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,320
It constantly projects out fast moving images.

53
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,500
We perceive these fast moving images as reality.

54
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,520
So we do not know our own mind.

55
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,760
And we do not know each other's mind.

56
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,260
We usually get confused.

57
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,740
Let me give the example of water.

58
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:57,120
Heavenly beings, they see water as glass floor.

59
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,440
Hungry ghosts, they see water as a pool of blood.

60
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,220
Fish, they see water as their habitat.

61
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,840
We humans see water as this liquid that we can use.

62
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,740
So we do not know what each other perceive in their mind.

63
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:17,040
Like a painter who knows not his mind, yet all his creations are made out of it.

64
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,120
This is the nature of all dharma.

65
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,120
So it's kind of what we call dharma.

66
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,900
As I explained already, the painter do not know his mind.

67
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:33,240
We do not know that our mind, our thoughts, create everything we experience.

68
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:39,740
If you are experiencing a horrible life, you think the physical environment is really bad,

69
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,160
that only means it's a projection of our mind.

70
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,900
It's corrupted and defiled.

71
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,600
It's from our thoughts from before.

72
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,740
Do not blame the physical environment.

73
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,740
It's all about our mind.

74
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,740
It's corrupted and defiled.

75
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,120
It's all from our own mind.

76
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,480
What we can do is just to change our mind to be wholesome and pure and good, then we

77
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,560
will create a world for our future that is good.

78
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,220
So even the five aggregates are manifestations of our mind.

79
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:14,380
The five aggregates are one, the form, our body, two, feelings, three, perception, four,

80
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,580
mental formation, five, consciousness.

81
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,540
All these are just conditioned, arising, created, and created.

82
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,540
All these are just conditions arising, created, and created.

83
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,540
All these are just conditions arising, created, and created.

84
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,740
These functions are all created by our mind.

85
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,040
When we say created by our minds, that means it's an illusion, emptiness.

86
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,980
When we say created by our mind, that means it's emptiness.

87
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:32,620
When you know it's an illusion, that's when we have no more selfishness, that's

88
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,140
when we are enlightened.

89
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:43,740
In the Perfect Enlightenment sutra it says to know illusions is to depart from them.

90
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,760
To depart from illusions is to be enlightened.

91
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,760
To know illusions is to be divinely enlightened.

92
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,300
All we have to do is to know, to awaken to the truth that everything is an illusion,

93
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,300
explained must be to know, to excita the Nirvana.

94
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,380
Now we need to know andります

95
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,620
to know and hinga eval Persianत 사람들 ports Tometdi Polamar He dissemit B extension by어�

96
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:57,160
illusion. When you know it's illusion, that's when you are enlightened. As is the mind,

97
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:03,260
so is the Buddha. As the Buddha, so are all sentient beings. One should know that the

98
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:09,660
Buddha and the mind in their essence are both boundless. So we say the mind, the Buddha

99
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:16,800
and sentient beings, these three have no differences. All Buddhas are sentient beings, all sentient

100
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,580
beings are Buddhas. Apart from this, there is no Buddha or sentient beings. The only

101
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:29,100
difference is one is awakened, one is confused. Just like one is sleeping all the time and

102
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:34,740
one is awakened all the time. That is the only difference. But in our true nature, everything

103
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:41,180
is equal and the same. Everyone knows that it is the volition of the mind that forms

104
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:46,780
the wide world. He then is able to see the Buddha and understand the true nature of the

105
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:54,800
Buddha. If we just know that everything is created by our mind, then we are able to see

106
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:03,480
the Buddha because we know all forms are illusory. That's when we see emptiness in the conditional

107
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:11,380
arising. That's when we see the true nature of our mind. Once we know the truth about

108
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:16,580
the conventional truth and the ultimate truth, that's when we are enlightened.

109
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:22,880
We are no longer confused, our ignorance is gone, and our Dharma body appears and we

110
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:28,920
immediately arrive at the other shore. The mind does not abide in this body, nor the

111
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:36,340
body abide in this mind, yet it is able to perform deeds of Buddha freely and unprecedented.

112
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:42,500
Our mind is not in this physical body, as we perceive. Like in the Shakyamuni Sutra,

113
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,760
Buddha asked Ananda, where is your mind? Ananda had many answers.

114
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:54,260
Including it's inside, outside, in the middle. Buddha says it's none of it. Why is that? Because

115
00:07:54,260 --> 00:08:00,480
our mind is nowhere, but it's everywhere. It's emptiness. If we really understand that,

116
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:06,940
then we can really be like a true bodhisattva who sacrificed and helped all sentient beings

117
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:13,120
without leaving a trace behind. We call it the three spheres of emptiness. There is not

118
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,860
a me who is giving, the giver. There is not the gift in me who is giving, the giver. There

119
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,740
is not the gift in me who is giving, the giver. There is not the gift in me who is giving,

120
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,220
the gift in me who is giving, the giver. There is not the giver in between, and there is

121
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:24,720
not the receiver. All three are empty in nature. That's when we are really free and

122
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,100
have unconditional love and compassion for all.

123
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:36,100
In conclusion, if one wants to understand all Buddhas from the past, present and the

124
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:42,400
future, he should contemplate on the nature of the Dharma realm. All is but the mind's

125
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,740
creation. If you want to understand who is Buddha, of

126
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:53,280
the past, present, and future, you should understand the nature of the dharma realm,

127
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:59,560
which is that everything is created by our own mind. We are the artists that paint this

128
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:05,180
world. If we want to change this world, we change our mind. We can really change our

129
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:12,740
mind because it's originally pure and bright. It is the suchness. If we are angry, we create

130
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:19,900
hell. If we are greedy, we create the hungry ghost realm. If we are ignorant, we create

131
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:26,640
the animal realm. If in one moment we are awakened to our true nature, in that moment

132
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:33,120
there's no more reincarnation to be painted. In that one moment, we go back to the Buddha

133
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:40,220
Dharma realm. We are really the Buddha. That's why it's best we chant Amitabha all the time

134
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,720
because in that single moment of change, we can change the world.

135
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:49,060
Chanting Amitabha, we are awakened to our true Buddha nature, and in that moment, we

136
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:56,140
are Amitabha. One delusional, unwholesome thought, we are the demon. One wholesome,

137
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:02,380
enlightened thought, we are the Buddha. It's all between one single thought in this present

138
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:10,280
moment. The fate of our own lives, our family, and our country, our world, can all be changed

139
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,160
by changing our mind.

140
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:12,680
Amitabha.

141
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:20,560
If people are kind, then disaster will dissipate. If people are unkind, then disaster will occur.

142
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:27,400
So it's all up to us to change our mind to be wholesome and pure because that is in alignment

143
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,560
with our own pure, bright nature.

144
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,080
That's the class for today. Thank you for listening. Amitabha.
