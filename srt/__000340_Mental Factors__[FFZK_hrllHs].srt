00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,140
Today we are going to talk about mental factors.

2
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,840
This is from the Consciousness Only School of Buddhism.

3
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,280
It talks about the working of our minds to get rid of our defilements and afflictions

4
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,920
and transform our ignorance consciousness into wisdom.

5
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:39,520
Now let's look at the five universal mental factors and five particular state mental factors.

6
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,140
First look at the five universal mental factors.

7
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,880
It's called universal for four reasons.

8
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:53,760
One, it happens all the time, two, it happens in all places, three, it happens in all eight

9
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,260
consciousnesses, and four, it happens in all three states.

10
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:05,120
It happens all the time, that means no matter which realm you're in in this reincarnation,

11
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:11,060
whether you're a saint or a mundane, you all have these five universal mental factors.

12
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:16,240
Number two is in all places, doesn't matter which realm you're in, you will have these

13
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,940
mental factors.

14
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:25,020
Number three, it happens in all eight consciousnesses, your eye consciousness, your ear consciousness,

15
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:31,780
nose, tongue, body, mind, these are your six consciousnesses.

16
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:38,700
Number seven is your manas, your seven consciousness, that's how you perceive the idea of the self,

17
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,700
that's your ego.

18
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,700
Then you have the eighth consciousness, the big storehouse.

19
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,500
All eight consciousnesses have these five mental factors.

20
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,560
Number four is universal in three natures of karma.

21
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,740
One is wholesome.

22
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,760
Two is unwholesome.

23
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,480
Three is neutral.

24
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,620
In all three states, you will have these mental factors.

25
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:06,240
Now let's look at these five mental factors.

26
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,460
Number one is attention.

27
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,180
You pay attention to a certain sense object.

28
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:17,480
For example, if you're in a party, there's lots of people talking, you will focus your

29
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,320
attention on one person that you're talking to.

30
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,540
Sometimes when you're eating, you don't taste the food that you ate.

31
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,720
Or you're listening to the radio, but the song already passed, but you didn't hear anything.

32
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,600
That's because this mental factor of attention is not working.

33
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:40,220
We want to bring our attention to the mental object we want to focus on.

34
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,620
In Reader's Digest, there was a funny story.

35
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,880
A young girl, she got her first paycheck.

36
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,900
She was very happy so she went to the mall and got herself a beautiful hat.

37
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,540
She went home, hoping her mom would praise her for the beautiful hat.

38
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,540
Then she was home.

39
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,540
She was very happy.

40
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,540
So she went to the mall and got herself a beautiful hat.

41
00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:01,740
hat but mom was busy cooking didn't say anything didn't even notice at dinner time she showed her

42
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:09,060
dissatisfaction mom asked what is wrong with you she said i bought this beautiful hat with my first

43
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:16,580
paycheck but you didn't even notice mom said oh i got my hair permed today you didn't notice either

44
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:24,300
so everybody only notice what they want to notice we want to choose the mental object that we

45
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:31,660
pay attention to that is called proper attention when we are meditating or focusing on a mental

46
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:39,800
object number two is contact so this contact is our sixth sense organ contact with sixth sense

47
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:47,400
objects then we develop sixth sense consciousness that's how we experience this world our eyes

48
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:53,100
ears nose tongue body and mind that's the sixth sense organ

49
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,220
come in

50
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:54,280
come in

51
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:54,300
come in

52
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,020
come in contact with the sixth sense objects

53
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:04,940
of sight sound smell taste touch and dharma then we develop sixth sense consciousnesses

54
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:10,540
that's how we experience this world one day there was a little wasp on the floor

55
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:17,740
i picked it up and prayed for it chen amitabha for it by coming in contact with this wasp

56
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:24,280
i feel the impermanence of life that contact was a special experience for me

57
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,720
i know a lot about mandrake pack because

58
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:33,620
everything he said pretty much every day i was frustrated every day for every posture

59
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:50,700
i learned a lot about

60
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,880
something but i still feel uncomfortable about it

61
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,060
Unfavorable feelings is when we want to be apart from it.

62
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,940
There is a monkey who was being massaged by a lady.

63
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,220
Because he liked it so much, every time the lady tried to stop,

64
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:09,180
he would grab her hand and put it on his head, wishing for more massage.

65
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,400
It's a pleasurable feeling for the monkey.

66
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,900
So he wants it to repeat over and over again.

67
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,820
So we can actually choose the feeling.

68
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,080
It's all up to us to feel pleasure or pain.

69
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,620
Number four is perception, our distinguishing thoughts.

70
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,800
Our feelings will affect our perceptions or vice versa.

71
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,300
Every situation, we can choose to have positive, wholesome thoughts.

72
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:42,100
For example, we should always choose to be kind instead of being right all the time.

73
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,600
We can choose to be grateful instead of complaining.

74
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,140
We can choose not to be offended

75
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:48,800
and always be grateful.

76
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,220
We can always live in a friendly, happy world.

77
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:57,300
And we can choose to look at other people's good qualities instead of looking at people's faults.

78
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:03,480
Always choose to be positive and wholesome, and we will create positive karma for us.

79
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,200
Number five is deliberation.

80
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,820
Careful contemplation is also called a mental urge.

81
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:15,400
Mental urge to take physical or verbal actions.

82
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,120
This is how we start taking action.

83
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,720
And create karma.

84
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,440
It has three stages.

85
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,200
One is planning.

86
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,940
Two, deciding.

87
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,980
Three, taking actions.

88
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:33,980
Our deliberation goes through these three steps before we take action to speak or move.

89
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:38,980
Again, we want to choose wholesome actions and speeches.

90
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,560
There was a man in a very crowded street.

91
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,900
All of a sudden, it started pouring rain.

92
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,740
He saw a lady in a wheelchair.

93
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,580
He had an umbrella.

94
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:54,000
So he put the umbrella over the lady and escorted her all the way home.

95
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,340
His deliberation helped him decide to take this action of giving.

96
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:04,300
This is through planning, deciding, and taking action.

97
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,580
Every one thought goes through these five mental factors.

98
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,800
So it's shorter than an instant.

99
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,000
But when we talk about it, it's in five different mental factors.

100
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,180
By understanding the details of our thoughts, we can take action.

101
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,180
We can take action.

102
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:17,380
We can take action.

103
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:17,480
We can take action.

104
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:17,560
We can take action.

105
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,140
We can take action.

106
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:18,420
We can take action.

107
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:24,180
We are able to choose positive, wholesome thoughts, and change our karma,

108
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,320
change our lives for the better.

109
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:31,280
Now, let's look at the five particular state mental factors.

110
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,120
These five factors are not like the universal mental factors.

111
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,540
These five all have to happen.

112
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,920
And it happens in this sequential order.

113
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,040
But these five do not happen all the time.

114
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,460
They only happen in specific situations.

115
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:55,900
situations. Number one is intention. Intention only happens when we have pleasurable states.

116
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:02,060
Only things that you like, you will have positive intention. You'll be motivated to keep doing

117
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:08,780
it. Some people are motivated by money. Some people are motivated by fame. Some people

118
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:16,220
are motivated to meditate. Everybody is motivated by different states, but all has to be pleasurable

119
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:22,680
state. So whatever gives you pleasure is what motivates your life to take action. What is

120
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:31,140
the subject of your motivation is very important. Number two, resolution. Resolution only happens

121
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:37,620
in states requiring decisiveness. In this state, when we are trying to decide, we will

122
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:44,080
make a firm conviction, strong belief about certain things. All these can be wholesome

123
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,200
or unwholesome, depending on the state.

124
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:54,020
For example, we might have a resolution about Pure Land Buddhism. You believe that chanting

125
00:08:54,020 --> 00:09:00,360
the name Amitabha is the most powerful mantra, and once we are chanting, we are immediately

126
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:07,000
aligned with our Buddha nature. There was a grandma chanting Amitabha, but her grandson

127
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,200
think it's very annoying, so he played a joke on her. One day, he started saying, Grandma,

128
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,180
Grandma, Grandma. In the beginning, grandma thought it was very sweet, but then she started

129
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:25,160
saying, please stop, this is very annoying. The grandson said, see, if you keep chanting

130
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:32,820
Amitabha, Amitabha will be so annoyed too. Grandma, she retrogressed and stopped chanting.

131
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:40,160
That means she doesn't have strong resolution about Pure Land Buddhism. So we have to decide,

132
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:46,040
make a firm determination and conviction about a certain subject.

133
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:53,060
Number three is mindfulness. Mindfulness is what states already experience. For example,

134
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:58,440
if you look at a Buddha picture, once you close your eyes, you still have the image

135
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:04,760
in your mind. Or you hear a song, after you stop listening to it, you still have the melody

136
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:11,680
in your mind. That's because we have this mental factor of mindfulness. It always remembers

137
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,880
states that you have experienced before.

138
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,880
This is very useful.

139
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:23,320
This is very useful because in our meditation, we have a method called visualization or contemplation.

140
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:29,060
Our mind is very powerful because it remembers. If you want to visualize the Western Pure

141
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:36,640
Land, you can study the 16 Contemplation Sutra that will teach you how to meditate on Amitabha's

142
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:44,640
Pure Land. This is very powerful when we remember. We can go into deep meditation with our visualization.

143
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,640
Number four.

144
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,640
Contemplate.

145
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,640
Number four is concentration.

146
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,480
This is what states want to contemplate on.

147
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:57,720
You have a state, object that you want to focus on, some people are very focused on

148
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,000
their career.

149
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:06,720
They have a strong mental factor of concentration, they are most likely to succeed in their career.

150
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,760
Some people are very concentrated on playing video games because their mental factor is

151
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,080
very strong.

152
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,240
Some people are stronger, some people are weaker.

153
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,440
Some people are very weak.

154
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:22,540
If we have a strong concentration in chanting the name Amitabha, we will reach single-pointed

155
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:27,700
awareness or we call it Buddha Remembrance Samadhi.

156
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:33,620
All these can be wholesome or unwholesome depending on the subject that you focus on.

157
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:40,340
A thief can be very concentrated in stealing, but that would be unwholesome, but his concentration

158
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,700
can be very strong as well.

159
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,660
So all depending on your subject of awareness.

160
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,580
Number five, wisdom.

161
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:52,020
This wisdom is not the wisdom of Prajna.

162
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,260
This wisdom means your ability to make judgments.

163
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,040
It's your distinguishing awareness.

164
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,980
You can distinguish what's good, what's bad.

165
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:07,340
For example, a thief can have a strong wisdom, mental factor and how to steal.

166
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:11,920
Everybody has their secret of how to do a certain subject.

167
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,680
That's the wisdom.

168
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,720
So it can be wholesome or unwholesome.

169
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,800
Stage one, contemplate on.

170
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,080
Whatever you focus on and contemplate on, that's the subject.

171
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:28,060
In conclusion, all dharmas have no self.

172
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:32,400
All these mental factors, you don't see a me or I.

173
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,860
There's no such thing.

174
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:37,300
The I that we think of is a pseudo self.

175
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,840
It's only our ego.

176
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,640
We want to get away from the ego and go back to the ego.

177
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,640
We want to get away from the ego and go back to the ego.

178
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,640
We want to get away from the ego and go back to the ego.

179
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,640
We want to get away from the ego and go back to the ego.

180
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,640
We want to get away from the ego and go back to the ego.

181
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,640
We want to get away from the ego and go back to the ego.

182
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,640
We want to get away from the ego and go back to our Buddha nature, our true suchness.

183
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,820
The only way is to become wholesome and purify our consciousness.

184
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,400
Turn from contaminated to purity.

185
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,880
That's when we reach enlightenment.

186
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,700
Change our ignorance consciousness into wisdom.

187
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,620
So it's from everyday experience.

188
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,540
Be aware of these mental factors.

189
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,940
Watch your thoughts.

190
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,680
Pick wholesome thoughts instead of bad thoughts.

191
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,180
Watch your thoughts.

192
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,640
Pick wholesome thoughts instead of bad thoughts.

193
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,640
Defilements, afflictions, greed, anger, ignorance.

194
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,640
Defilements, afflictions, greed, anger, ignorance.

195
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,640
Defilements, afflictions, greed, anger, ignorance.

196
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,640
Defilements, afflictions, greed, anger, ignorance.

197
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,580
Turn your life around.

198
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,280
Change from a mundane to a sane.

199
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,140
That's what Buddha wants us to cultivate.

200
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,400
So this is Chinese New Year.

201
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:35,780
We should really use our time wisely, diligently, watching every one of our mental factors.

202
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:42,360
If you're unaware of how your mind is functioning in everyday life, there is no way you can

203
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:50,120
change yourself. So in this new year, hopefully we can all make this a wonderful year of enlightenment.
