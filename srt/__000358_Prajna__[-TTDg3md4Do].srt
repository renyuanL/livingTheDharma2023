00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,880
Today we are going to talk about Prajna, which means transcendental wisdom or direct insight into the truth of life that can resolve all our problems and sufferings.

2
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:31,720
We will use verses from Shakyamuni Sutra to discuss Prajna.

3
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:45,880
First, it says you simply do not know that in the treasury of the Thus Come One, the nature of form is true emptiness. The nature of emptiness is true form.

4
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:53,880
There are three kinds of Prajna. One is literary Prajna. Two is contemplative Prajna.

5
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,880
Three is real Mark Prajna.

6
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:01,880
Literary Prajna, which is the sutra itself, the words, the language.

7
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,880
Two, in order to reach Prajna, you must contemplate on it.

8
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,880
Three, you will reach the real Mark Prajna.

9
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,880
Real Mark is our goal. This Buddha nature, we call it the real Mark, it actually has two parts.

10
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:24,880
A has no mark. Two, it's not without a mark. Everything has this mark.

11
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,880
No mark means no form, no existence.

12
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,880
Not without mark means all the wonderful existence of the world.

13
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:41,880
The reason we are not enlightened because we simply do not know that in the treasury of the Thus Come One.

14
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:49,880
Buddha is the Thus Come One. Our mind is the treasure. Our Buddha nature is within our mind.

15
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,880
But we do not know we have to look for this treasure.

16
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,880
You gotta first have this Prajna.

17
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,880
So the Prajna is basically these two lines.

18
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,880
If you can understand these two lines, you will get the real mark.

19
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,880
The nature of form is true emptiness.

20
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:17,880
Everything you see in this world, all the appearances, all your life situations, they are truly empty.

21
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,880
And the nature of emptiness is true form.

22
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,880
Which means the non-existence is its existence.

23
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,880
We often say emptiness does not obstruct wonderful existence.

24
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:36,880
And wonderful existence does not obstruct emptiness.

25
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,880
Emptiness is not really empty.

26
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,880
And form is not really existing.

27
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:50,880
Because emptiness is not really empty, that's why it's called wonderful existence or form.

28
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,880
And form does not really exist.

29
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,880
Therefore, it's called true emptiness.

30
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:06,880
If you can understand that all forms are emptiness and all emptiness are form, then that's the Prajna.

31
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:16,880
For example, in Shakyama Sutra, Buddha says our body and mind, all these forms are empty in nature.

32
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,880
For example, your tongue tastes delicious food.

33
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,880
And we start having sense of greed in the consciousness.

34
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,880
How did this form come about?

35
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,880
Buddha explains in detail.

36
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:34,880
It's not from the tongue because the tongue cannot taste the tongue itself.

37
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:41,880
It's not from the delicious food because it doesn't have connection with our own consciousness.

38
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:48,880
And it's not from the empty space inside of our mouth because it will have all kinds of flavors.

39
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,880
Therefore, our greed.

40
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,880
Our greed for this food doesn't really exist.

41
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:02,880
Only if we understand emptiness, we will let go of our attachment to food, fame, fortune.

42
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:09,880
Everything that we conceive of as important and in our possession, we can really let go.

43
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:15,880
If you don't have this Prajna, you will never want to let it go because you see it as something great.

44
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,880
So seeing the emptiness is very important.

45
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:25,880
But not only do we see emptiness, we need to see that emptiness is in all the forms.

46
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:31,880
So we can use the form, use this food to donate to people that are in need.

47
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,880
So a Bodhisattva always understands emptiness.

48
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,880
So they let go of their afflictions and they always understand what is existing right now.

49
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,880
We got to use it to be a Bodhisattva and help this universe.

50
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,880
Buddha keeps repeating these two lines.

51
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,880
The Heart Sutra says exactly the same thing.

52
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,880
You let go of this form.

53
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,880
All your five skandhas.

54
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:03,880
Form, feelings, perception, mental formation, your consciousness.

55
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,880
None of it is real.

56
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,880
It's not because of cause and conditions.

57
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,880
Because cause and conditions never really rise or cease.

58
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,880
They are all empty of self-nature.

59
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:23,880
It's also not from spontaneity because it's not coming out of nowhere either.

60
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,880
What is the source of all forms?

61
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,880
The answer is just right here in these two lines.

62
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,880
The nature of form is true emptiness.

63
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,880
The nature of emptiness is true form.

64
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,880
This is called Prajna.

65
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,880
So emptiness is no mark.

66
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,880
Form is not without mark.

67
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,880
If you can understand the similarity and difference between the two,

68
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,880
transform your life based on this Prajna,

69
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,880
then you can solve all your sufferings.

70
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,880
Right now we cannot solve our afflictions and sufferings

71
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,880
because we are so attached to the form.

72
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,880
When we are poor, when we are sick, when we are depressed,

73
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,880
we think it's so real.

74
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,880
That's why we cannot see emptiness.

75
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,880
We cannot see our true mind.

76
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,880
If you really understand,

77
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,880
the nature of form is emptiness,

78
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,880
you will not be caught up in it.

79
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,880
Then you can be a true Bodhisattva.

80
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,880
So this is the essence of our mind.

81
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,880
The next two lines explain the same thing.

82
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,880
It's in a summary.

83
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,880
Pure at its origin, it pervades the Dharma realm.

84
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,880
Pure at its origin, it's A, which means no mark, emptiness.

85
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,880
Everything is pure in its origin.

86
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,880
Nothing is protection or extinction.

87
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,880
Nothing is rising or ceasing.

88
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,880
All you see in this world is things happening in a dream.

89
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,880
You have to let go of all the attachment

90
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,880
because it's originally pure.

91
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,880
You don't have a self.

92
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,880
You don't have an ego.

93
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,880
You don't have attachment to these people, place and things

94
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,880
because it's empty.

95
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,880
On the other hand, it pervades the Dharma realm.

96
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,880
It's not without mark.

97
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,880
Every one of your thoughts will pervade the entire world.

98
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,880
That's why we still need to cultivate.

99
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,880
Just one sound of omitofo or the mantra,

100
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,880
it pervades the entire Dharma realm

101
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,880
because our mind is so powerful.

102
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,880
Although everything is empty,

103
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,880
one thought can travel the entire universe.

104
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,880
One sound of chanting will provide merits for all sentient beings.

105
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,880
So we gotta bring out our Bodhi results.

106
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,880
Do all that is good and change our afflictions.

107
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,880
Be a true Bodhisattva.

108
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,880
These two lines are summarizing the first two lines.

109
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,880
So pure, again, is emptiness.

110
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,880
It pervades everywhere.

111
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,880
It uses the form in this world to cultivate.

112
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,880
You can be the best version of yourself.

113
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,880
You will get rid of all your sufferings,

114
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,880
all your attachments, all your problems,

115
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,880
all your problems of the world.

116
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,880
This is the essence.

117
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,880
It's empty and it's true form.

118
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,880
It also has its functions.

119
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,880
It accords with living beings' minds

120
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,880
in response to its capacity to know.

121
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,880
It is experienced to whatever extent

122
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,880
is dictated by the law of karma.

123
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,880
Even though it's empty in nature,

124
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,880
it still has its function.

125
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,880
All your experience in life

126
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,880
is because what's going on in your mind.

127
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,880
Nothing happening outside

128
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,880
is really happening outside of your mind.

129
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,880
In other words,

130
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,880
like begets like

131
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,880
because the mind creates everything.

132
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,880
If you're easily offended,

133
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,880
you are likely to meet a lot of people

134
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,880
that's gonna offend you.

135
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,880
If you're always jealous,

136
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,880
you will see a lot of people in your life

137
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,880
that will make you jealous and feel miserable.

138
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,880
If you're always afraid of failure,

139
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,880
you are likely to fail

140
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,880
because it's all in accordance with your mind.

141
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,880
That's why we gotta use our mind wisely.

142
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,880
We gotta use it to appreciate life,

143
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,880
to have compassion.

144
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,880
Then you create the Pure Land.

145
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,880
Where does the Pure Land come from?

146
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,880
It's actually from your mind as well.

147
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,880
It's in direct response to our capacity

148
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,880
to know the capacity of our mind.

149
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,880
How big your heart is.

150
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,880
The bigger your heart,

151
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,880
the better your life.

152
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,880
If your heart is always selfish,

153
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,880
then you attract a life that is full of difficulties.

154
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,880
If you are kind and compassionate,

155
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,880
you will attract people who are compassionate

156
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,880
and that's always helping you and loving you.

157
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,880
So it's all in accordance to our mind.

158
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,880
There are three people who watched a video clip

159
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,880
about a mother bear climbing

160
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,880
a snowy mountain with her cub.

161
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,880
The mother quickly climbed up to the top of the mountain.

162
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,880
The cub, because of his small size and inexperience,

163
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,880
he was having trouble scaling the mountain.

164
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,880
So every time he slipped off,

165
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,880
but he does not give up,

166
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,880
he would go another route,

167
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,880
hoping for a better grip.

168
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,880
But every time he reached almost the top,

169
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,880
he slips off again.

170
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,880
He tried at least ten times.

171
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,880
Finally,

172
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,880
the last time he made it up there.

173
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,880
These three people,

174
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,880
they have different point of view

175
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,880
seeing this clip.

176
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,880
The first person said,

177
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,880
Oh, my life is miserable

178
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,880
because I'm like the cub

179
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,880
that had too many obstacles.

180
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,880
It's because of the obstacles.

181
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,880
It's not my problem.

182
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,880
It's really the situation to blame.

183
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,880
So he is always a miserable person

184
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,880
having a terrible life.

185
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,880
The second person,

186
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,880
he said,

187
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,880
Oh, you know,

188
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,880
the cub always tried everything.

189
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,880
He went another route.

190
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,880
He kept going and kept trying.

191
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,880
Maybe I should try something else.

192
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,880
If I don't have a job right now,

193
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,880
I should try a different field.

194
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,880
So the second person

195
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,880
tried to resolve his life issues.

196
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,880
The third person,

197
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,880
he says,

198
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,880
A little cub never give up

199
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,880
because he wants to reach the top.

200
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,880
Me as a cultivator,

201
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,880
a bodhisattva,

202
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,880
how can I give up?

203
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,880
I should never give up

204
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,880
on helping others,

205
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,880
on being good,

206
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,880
on having integrity,

207
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,880
on changing my afflictions.

208
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,880
So everybody's life

209
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,880
is dependent on your capacity to know.

210
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,880
No one is controlling your destiny.

211
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,880
Your destiny is in your own hand.

212
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,880
What kind of mind,

213
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,880
what kind of mentality,

214
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,880
what kind of attitude

215
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,880
do you have about life?

216
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,880
It's not blaming others.

217
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,880
It's your own willpower,

218
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,880
your belief,

219
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,880
and having the prajna,

220
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,880
knowing the emptiness of all things

221
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,880
and you can use the form

222
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,880
to be the best that you can.

223
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,880
Lastly,

224
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,880
it is experience

225
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,880
to whatever extent

226
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,880
is dictated by the law of karma.

227
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,880
Karma never make any mistakes.

228
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,880
You reap what you sow.

229
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,880
Whatever is in your mind,

230
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,880
your good thought,

231
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,880
your bad thought,

232
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,880
your wholesome thoughts,

233
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,880
your unwholesome thoughts,

234
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,880
make up your current life.

235
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,880
Your situation,

236
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,880
your body,

237
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,880
you as a woman

238
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,880
or a man,

239
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,880
your job,

240
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,880
your family,

241
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,880
everything is in accordance

242
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,880
with the law of karma.

243
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,880
Nothing is a mistake.

244
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,880
So understanding our true nature

245
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,880
is to transform our life

246
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,880
for the better.

247
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,880
You know who you are.

248
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,880
You know all the forms are empty.

249
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,880
It's really up to me.

250
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,880
Use the form to be the best that I can.

251
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,880
If you really believe in karma,

252
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,880
you will change your afflictions.

253
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,880
What's most important

254
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,880
is to change your temper.

255
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,880
Anger is usually what brings us

256
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,880
to the three lower realms.

257
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,880
There is karma to your temper.

258
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,880
People that are in hell

259
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,880
is because of anger.

260
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,880
Some people are angry

261
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,880
on the outside.

262
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,880
They show it.

263
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,880
Others, they hold it in

264
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,880
but they don't show it outside.

265
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,880
What I'm talking about

266
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,880
is not having anger

267
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,880
inside or outside.

268
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,880
How do we get rid of this anger?

269
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,880
By having prajna.

270
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,880
All the situations are empty.

271
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,880
Use this situation

272
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,880
to get rid of my anger.

273
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,880
I should not blame others

274
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,880
for my misery.

275
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,880
Reflect inward

276
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,880
and see my own problem.

277
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,880
If in your life

278
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,880
everyone is against you,

279
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,880
you should really go inside

280
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,880
and confess.

281
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,880
That's your karma.

282
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,880
If you want to change the situation,

283
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,880
it's not to change them.

284
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,880
It's to change your heart.

285
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,880
You have the heart of the Buddha.

286
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,880
It's all up to you

287
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,880
to use it

288
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,880
to change your life.

289
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,880
Don't forsake what is near

290
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,880
and run after what is far away.

291
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,880
Grab for something outside.

292
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,880
Blame others.

293
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,880
Change others.

294
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,880
We're only adding a head

295
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,880
on top of a head.

296
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,880
Just like

297
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,880
you're trying to look for glasses.

298
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,880
You're like,

299
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,880
who stole my glasses?

300
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,880
Who stole my glasses?

301
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,880
But you're wearing already.

302
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,880
So you already have

303
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,880
the true nature within you.

304
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,880
You're just not looking

305
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,880
in the right places.

306
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,880
You're looking far away.

307
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,880
You're not looking here.

308
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,880
That's why Buddha is trying to tell us

309
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,880
in all these Mahayana Buddhism,

310
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,880
in the Heart Sutra,

311
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,880
in the Shravagama Sutra,

312
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,880
because Buddha really wants you

313
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,880
to get this prajna,

314
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,880
this real mark,

315
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,880
which is our real self,

316
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,880
to know the truth about life.

317
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,880
So that's the class for today.

318
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,880
Thank you for listening.

319
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,880
Amitabha.
