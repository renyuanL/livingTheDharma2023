1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,400
Today we are going to talk about Peaceful Practice.

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,240
How do we have peace and happiness in this chaotic world?

3
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,920
We will learn about Chapter 14 of the Lotus Sutra in order to understand peaceful practice.

4
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,120
Basically, we need to develop four kinds of peaceful practices.

5
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,380
Number one, peaceful deeds.

6
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,580
Number two, peaceful words.

7
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,880
Number three, peaceful thoughts.

8
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,040
Number four, peaceful vows.

9
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,720
Let's look at number one, peaceful deeds.

10
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,400
It has two subsections.

11
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,100
Number one, sphere of practice.

12
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,740
This is the overview of a Bodhisattva practice.

13
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:58,360
We need to abide in the stage of perseverance and be gentle and tranquil.

14
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:04,340
This means that we should constantly dwell in our Buddha nature, the suchness, and be

15
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:10,740
patient and tolerant toward those who harm us, insult us, or slander us.

16
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:17,140
Oftentimes when other people hurt us, we might just try to hold the precept and force ourselves

17
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,140
not to get angry.

18
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:24,240
But deep down inside, we still have a lot of resentment and opposition.

19
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,000
But if we really reside in our true nature, then we will be peaceful.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This means that we should constantly dwell in our Buddha nature, the suchness, and be

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
patient and tolerant toward those who harm us, insult us, or slander us.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,080
Then we will naturally be gentle and tranquil.

23
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,260
This gentleness is not fearful.

24
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,220
We are gentle because we are selfless.

25
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:44,540
And we are tranquil because we are calmly staying at home and our true nature is unmoved

26
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:48,960
by the external environment because we know they are impermanent.

27
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,100
So, this is the basis of our practice.

28
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,260
Number two is sphere of relationships.

29
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,980
How do we practice?

30
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:04,920
daily basis. We need to stay away from 10 kinds of people and situations. I will just

31
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:11,320
disclose three. Number one is to stay away from high government officials because they

32
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:18,060
might bring out our desire for fame and fortune. We might not be able to convert them. They

33
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:24,680
might be converting us. So we want to stay away. Number two, we want to stay away from

34
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:31,880
violent games such as wrestling or boxing because it might bring out the belligerence

35
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:38,220
in us. Number three, we should stay away from promiscuous men or women because they might

36
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:44,660
bring out our lust and feeling of desire. So we need to be very selective. We still

37
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:51,840
love everyone equally, but we need to choose our environment in order to protect our bodhisattva

38
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,660
practice. Then we need to have confidence.

39
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,000
We need to have contemplation. We need to regard all dharma as being without substance

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,080
like empty space. So this is void meditation. We want to see the emptiness of all things.

41
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,480
Our mind should have a quality like the sky that is empty and boundless.

42
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,680
Fifteen years ago, we were living in an apartment in the city. There was an apartment manager.

43
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:24,680
His name was Sid. He was 90 years old and he was still very active and healthy. He was

44
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:31,820
managing many apartment complexes. So I asked him, what is your secret of longevity? He

45
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:39,640
told me, oh easy, nothing up here. So he doesn't keep anything in his mind. When we don't have

46
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:46,640
a lot of deluded thinking, our Buddha nature will naturally surface. Number two is peaceful

47
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:54,280
words. No slander or talk of the good or bad, strong and weak points of others. If you want

48
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:00,840
peace, do not speak ill of others. We do not want to make remarks about other people's

49
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:07,680
good or bad conduct or talk about the strong points or the shortcomings of others. When

50
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:17,380
we are judging others, usually we have affliction, either love or hate. Our only goal is to eradicate

51
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:23,280
our own afflictions. We are not so concerned about the right or wrong of others. You might

52
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,540
say, what is wrong with this.

53
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:30,380
with praising the strong points and good qualities of others isn't that good we should still be

54
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:37,840
discerning and see it's proper make sure we are not saying it to flatter we want to benefit them

55
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:45,420
in their cultivation want them to be liberated our heart must be straightforward and genuine

56
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:52,340
and if we are straightforward and genuine even if we scold someone in order to teach them that

57
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:59,100
doesn't break this precept so precept is all dependent on your intention we want to learn

58
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:07,060
the spirit of the precept which is to benefit and help all sentient beings there was a master

59
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:15,700
named Hong Yi he helped pure precepts whenever his disciples have afflictions or not getting along

60
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:21,840
having problem he would not say anything all he does is refrain from eating

61
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,320
you

62
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:28,860
when he did that everybody knew there's something wrong with the disciples sincerely confess their

63
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:36,940
sins that's when he would start eating so that is a great virtuous teacher number three is peaceful

64
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:44,780
thoughts we often say if there's no affliction inside then there is no problem outside all problem

65
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:51,540
comes from our own afflictions inside so we need to understand our afflictions here it point out four

66
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,300
major

67
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:59,400
afflictions first is jealousy we might be jealous of others who are doing better than us this is out

68
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:07,000
of our selfishness in the Bodhisattva precept it says a Bodhisattva should take the blame for others

69
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,480
and always let other people have the glory we should rejoice in other people's success and other

70
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:22,300
people's good cultivation number two is anger we do not want to disparage other people's faults number three

71
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:30,540
is no vaccine. We do not want to vax other cultivators to render them skeptical or remorseful

72
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:36,200
about their own practice. For example, we might say things like, all of you are far

73
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:43,420
away from the Bodhi or you will never be enlightened. These are all words that are sabotaging other

74
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:49,540
people's practice. This is a big offense. We do not want to cause any vaxation in other

75
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:57,360
cultivators. Number four is no contention. We do not want to discuss the Dharma for the

76
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:04,980
purpose of competition. We do not want to say Atharvada is better or Mahayana is better.

77
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:11,480
I'm a better cultivator. So all of these are competing. We do not want to have any kind

78
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:19,200
of contention with anyone. Always be in harmony and no argument. That's a true Bodhisattva.

79
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:26,900
All of these, they might be refined afflictions. They might be very subtle and unnoticeable

80
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:33,860
sometimes. True Bodhisattva, they will have very deep meditation and become very mindful

81
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:40,360
of their own affliction. They will see even the slightest impurities in their mind. Just

82
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:47,160
like we have a water filter. Before the holes are very big. They only filter the big pieces,

83
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,340
but now the filter is getting smaller.

84
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:49,520
Subtitles by the Amara.org community

85
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:56,020
more refined we are able to detect even the smallest impurities in our mind so

86
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:02,740
always watch out for our afflictions how do we conquer these problems we can have

87
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:09,300
unreal meditations we just conjure up an image to overcome our jealousy of others

88
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:14,860
we should nurture the thinking of great compassion be compassionate for the

89
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:21,080
other person we want them to be happy rejoice in their success in order to

90
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,900
have no anger we should nurture the thinking that they are our benevolent

91
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:32,200
father love them like our father so we should not be angry not to vast other

92
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:37,980
cultivators think of them as great masters stay humble know that everyone

93
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:43,200
else is my master and we shouldn't have any contention nurture the thought of

94
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,620
equality

95
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:51,320
because we are all equal in our Buddha nature we want to be able to detect and

96
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,980
eradicate our afflictions

97
00:08:53,980 --> 00:09:00,560
that's peaceful thought number four is peaceful vows bodhisattva always have

98
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:06,940
aspiration to be a saint to help all sentient beings here it points out two

99
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:12,340
ways one is to have great kindness to those who do not ask believe or

100
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,540
understand

101
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,580
number two

102
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:22,140
to have great compassion to those who do not hear, know, or realize the Dharma. So great

103
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:27,720
kindness is toward other cultivators. They already know and have been practicing for

104
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:34,740
a long time but they still might not ask you or believe you about the single vehicle of

105
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:41,200
the Mahayana Buddhism, about the Buddha nature. So we need to have great kindness in every

106
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:47,600
way we can to help them understand the Dharma. Then we should have great compassion toward

107
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,060
those who do not know the Dharma. It might be our family and friends. We should help

108
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:58,320
them because they have never heard of the Dharma and they don't know the Dharma and

109
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,800
they don't realize the Dharma. So they are suffering. We should feel their pain that

110
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:10,760
they don't know how to be liberated from reincarnation. We should try everything we can to help them

111
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,160
learn the Dharma.

112
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:17,240
To learn the Dharma and to learn Buddhism is all based on our kindness and compassion.

113
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:24,100
So it all brings us back to the overview which is staying in the stage of perseverance and

114
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,100
be gentle and tranquil.

115
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:33,060
Once upon a time there was a monkey who had great strength, wisdom, and a heart full of

116
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:40,060
kindness. One day while this monkey was climbing a tree, he saw a hunter who was trapped in

117
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,060
the deep valley.

118
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:46,900
The hunter was crying out for help. Wanting to rescue the hunter, the monkey climbed along

119
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:53,060
the cliff and reached the bottom of the valley. Then he carried the hunter on his back, climbed

120
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:57,020
through the rattan and bushes, and finally reached safe ground.

121
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:02,680
The hunter was trying to catch his breath while resting. He thought to himself, I am

122
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:09,220
really tired and starving. Let's just kill this monkey to feed myself. So he took a rock

123
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,900
and hit the monkey in the head.

124
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:18,400
The monkey was in shock, bled profusely, and was dying. Despite the ungrateful return of

125
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:26,620
his kindness, this monkey still managed to maintain a clear mind free of hatred. He felt

126
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:34,560
pity and compassion for the hunter and thought, today I cannot help him to get rid of his

127
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:40,460
evil ways, but I hope he will have the opportunity to meet a Buddha or Buddha.

128
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:48,960
Buddha or Bodhisattva one day to learn Buddhism, be liberated from anger and hatred, and attain

129
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:56,580
Buddhahood. So this is the Bodhisattva way, full of compassion and perseverance.

130
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:03,500
If we have these four peaceful practices, we will be able to have virtue and let other

131
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:09,960
people rely on us. Those people who are angry, when they see us, they will naturally feel

132
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:17,000
kind and loving, and those who are afraid, when they see you, they will feel secure and

133
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,900
protected. Those who are depressed, when they see you, they will feel happy and positive

134
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:29,580
and full of Dharma joy. Even poisonous animals, when they see you, they will feel gentle and

135
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:37,140
kind. So in order to have peace and happiness in this world, we must have peaceful deeds,

136
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,400
peaceful words, peaceful thoughts, and peaceful mind.

137
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:39,900
Thank you.

138
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:46,840
These four vows, this is actually practicing, and we will eventually attain compassion

139
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:53,920
samadhi. Then we know we are fully in accordance with our true nature, the pure enlightened

140
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,720
mind. So this is the secret to peace and happiness. Thank you for listening. Amitabha.
