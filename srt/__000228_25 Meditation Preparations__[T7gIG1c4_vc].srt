00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,680
Today we are going to talk about 25 Meditation Preparations.

2
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,680
Meditation is the training of our mind for two qualities.

3
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,000
First is concentration, we call it tranquility meditation.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,840
The second is wisdom, we call it insight meditation.

5
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,160
With these two qualities, we can reach enlightenment and Buddhahood.

6
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,400
Now let's talk about the 25 Meditation Preparations.

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,160
There are five categories, each with five subcategories.

8
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,200
So together for a total of 25, let's look at the first category.

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,200
Provide five conditions.

10
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,760
First, we need to withhold precepts.

11
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,480
Precepts develop concentration, concentration develops wisdom.

12
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,240
That's the order of practice.

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,960
So first, we need to hold our precepts.

14
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,560
For example, if I hold the precept of no lying and when I sit there and meditate,

15
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,200
I don't have to worry about someone find out about my lies and feel guilty.

16
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,680
So holding precept is wholesome karma that will allow us to sit and meditate for a long time.

17
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,120
Number two is we must have good living necessities.

18
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,880
Nowadays, we have a lot of abundance in food and clothing.

19
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,440
So the key is to treasure what we have.

20
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,960
Don't be negative and do not be wasteful.

21
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,960
Number three is we need to find a tranquil place to practice.

22
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,560
You might want to go to the mountains or to a monastery or you can just stay at your house.

23
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,240
Just find a room where you can be quiet and meditate for a short period of time.

24
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,240
As long as your mind is quiet, then no matter where you are, you can find peace and quietness.

25
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,040
Number four is to avoid distractions.

26
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,000
We want to avoid cell phones or computers.

27
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,560
You need to sacrifice for now in order to reach greatness, so you can become a Buddha

28
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,400
and help all sentient beings.

29
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:12,080
So it's actually great compassion by getting away from the distractions for now.

30
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,680
Number five is we need to have good companionship.

31
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,640
We need to have external supporters that help us with the living necessity.

32
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,080
We need to have companions who will not distract us, but will practice the same meditation

33
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,520
so we don't slack off.

34
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,160
And we need to have a good teacher that can guide us when we're having problems.

35
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,960
So these are the five basic conditions.

36
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,080
Number two, we need to reprimand five desires.

37
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,920
Our eyes like to see forms.

38
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,160
Our ears like to listen to sounds.

39
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,680
Our nose like to smell.

40
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,360
Our tongue likes to taste.

41
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,120
Our body like to touch.

42
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,120
All these are external stimulants that we think will make us happy.

43
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,600
Every day, we're seeking after them.

44
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,440
If you realize they are actually the cause of life and death, then you need to practice

45
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,160
them.

46
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,320
That's why we are reincarnating.

47
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,240
We need to reprimand them.

48
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,560
Not to close your eyes or close your ears, but have the wisdom.

49
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,280
Know that they're the cause of samsara.

50
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,760
I must detach because I already have the cause of happiness and the quiet mind inside of

51
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,160
me.

52
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,840
I don't need these outside stimulants to make me happy.

53
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,760
These are actually hurting you.

54
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,080
Just like you know the fire is gonna burn you, you stay away from fire.

55
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,280
You know the snake is...

56
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,080
poisonous.

57
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,080
You stay away from the poison.

58
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,920
You know thief is gonna steal your things.

59
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,520
You stay away from the thief.

60
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,600
So you want to stay away from the desires.

61
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,800
That way you can go into deep meditation.

62
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,720
Number three, we need to drive away five hindrances.

63
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,760
The desires are external obstacles.

64
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,480
The hindrances are internal obstacles, are internal emotions.

65
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,400
The first is greediness.

66
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,040
Sometimes we are just greedy for food.

67
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,280
For money, for lust, for fame, for sleep.

68
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,920
If you realize when you're chasing after these things, the chasing is already hard work.

69
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,360
That's already suffering.

70
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,840
And when you finally get the thing that you want, you're afraid to lose it.

71
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,440
That's also suffering.

72
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,480
And when you lost it, then you feel depressed.

73
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,000
That's more suffering.

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,680
So no matter at what stage, the chasing, the desire is full of suffering.

75
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,840
It's a vicious cycle.

76
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,280
So we want to let go of our cravings and desires.

77
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,160
That's how we can meditate and tap into the peace inside of us.

78
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,240
Number two is anger.

79
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,760
Greed is wanting things that are pleasant to us.

80
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,680
Anger is not wanting things that are unpleasant to us.

81
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,920
When we have anger inside of us, it's like our mind is at war.

82
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,200
It's not peaceful and it's full of fire.

83
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,800
You're likely to have a lot of pain and sickness.

84
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:04,720
So recognize your anger and be able to let them go because that's hindering our concentration.

85
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:11,440
If you look at those heavenly beings, they all have no anger and they all have deep concentration.

86
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,480
So we need to let go of our anger.

87
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,480
Number three is drowsiness.

88
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,120
Some people, they sit there and they start feeling sleepy, dozing off.

89
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,600
So that's actually a bad habit.

90
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,160
We need to form a good habit.

91
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,640
Once we close our eyes, we're going to be able to see the world.

92
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:26,800
We're going to be able to see the world.

93
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,000
Once we close our eyes, we're still aware.

94
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,360
What you can do is put your attention on the tip of your nose or you can visualize the

95
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,960
Buddha's lights in front of you that will also wake you up.

96
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,840
There are many ways that you can do so you can be away from drowsiness.

97
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,520
Number four is restlessness.

98
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,120
We are often restless in our body, mind, and speech.

99
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,280
Our body is likely to walk around when we're bored.

100
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,600
We go here and there trying to find something to do.

101
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,280
Our mouth is restless when we want to chat.

102
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,160
When our mind is restless, we always have a lot of wandering thoughts.

103
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,560
When you're always restless, you are not at peace.

104
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:13,040
Learn to rest, to really rest our mind and be able to sit there, meditate, and enjoy

105
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,960
our own presence and enjoy the present moment.

106
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,760
That's the essence of our happiness.

107
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,840
So why are we restless?

108
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,400
A lot of people, when they sit there, they start thinking, oh, how come I did that?

109
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,640
Earlier wasting a lot of my time or how come I said that or how come I did not say that

110
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,640
or did not do that?

111
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,520
Oh, I think I broke some precept.

112
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:40,800
So when you're lamenting over what you have done and have not done, you cannot focus on

113
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,540
the present moment.

114
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,560
So you cannot meditate.

115
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,020
Number five is doubt.

116
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,080
We often have doubt about ourselves.

117
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,500
Oh, I have a lot of wandering thoughts.

118
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,240
I don't think I can meditate.

119
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,120
Or you doubt the Dharma.

120
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,700
Should I do the chanting?

121
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,540
Or should I focus on my breathing?

122
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,540
What should I do?

123
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,540
You're skeptical.

124
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,540
Don't know what to do.

125
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,540
Or you doubt the teacher.

126
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,120
Oh, I don't think he or she is enlightened.

127
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,620
I don't think I can trust him.

128
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:10,580
So when you have doubt, you don't have faith, then you won't be able to accomplish any of

129
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,580
your endeavors.

130
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,420
Number four, we need to adjust five activities.

131
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,160
First, we need to adjust our meal.

132
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,020
We don't want to eat too much because all our blood will go to our stomach and we'll

133
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,700
be drowsy, won't be able to meditate.

134
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,700
And we don't want to eat too much.

135
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,200
If we eat too little, we'll be frail and weak.

136
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:33,940
The best is to eat just right so we're in the perfect physical state to meditate.

137
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:38,820
Develop a habit of a regular fasting, no eating after lunchtime.

138
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,260
It's actually great for your body and great for meditation.

139
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,260
Number two, we need to adjust our sleep.

140
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:50,100
We don't want to oversleep because sleep is actually ignorance.

141
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,740
Try to sleep just four to six hours.

142
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,540
Try to have a good night rest by not talking too much.

143
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:00,860
Or thinking a lot before you go to bed because if you do that, you're likely to have a lot

144
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,240
of dreams during your sleep and you won't be able to rest well.

145
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:10,160
The best sleep is no dreams and you just wake up fresh and ready for your meditation.

146
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,980
Number three and four and five, it goes together, our body, breath, and mind.

147
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,540
We need to adjust during our meditation.

148
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,220
First, our body.

149
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,540
We want to make sure our spine is straight when we meditate.

150
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,540
We don't force it straight.

151
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,540
We don't force it straight.

152
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:30,560
We just imagine something pulling us from the top so it's straight.

153
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:37,660
Everything else should be in deep relaxation like tofu, very soft and weightless.

154
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,480
That's how your whole body should be.

155
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:44,380
The more relaxed you are, the more you can go into deep meditation.

156
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:49,540
If you have any pain in your body, what you can do is observe the pain.

157
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,640
It's actually a kind of inside meditation.

158
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,540
You know exactly how the pain feels.

159
00:08:54,540 --> 00:09:01,680
The intensity of the pain and then you realize it's impermanent, it's not me, this body is

160
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,680
not mine.

161
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:08,800
Actually, you will develop great insight by watching your pain and the pain will likely

162
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,800
go away and heal itself.

163
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,360
So watching the body and our pain is actually a kind of good meditation.

164
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,880
Number four, we need to adjust our breathing.

165
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,540
There are four kinds of breathing.

166
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,540
First is windy breathing.

167
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,500
Some people breathe very loud.

168
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,800
That's not very good for meditation.

169
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,660
Or gasping, kind of like asthma, that's not good either.

170
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:35,020
Or we have lopsided, not even breathing.

171
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,360
Those three are not good.

172
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,300
The last one is even, smooth breathing.

173
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,560
That's the best for our meditation.

174
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,280
But we don't control our breathing.

175
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:49,980
What we do is we just relax our whole body and the breathing will naturally follow, become

176
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,680
even, smooth and refined.

177
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,680
So watch your breathing.

178
00:09:52,680 --> 00:10:00,100
So watching our breathing is actually the best way to meditate and go into deep concentration.

179
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,620
Number five, we need to adjust our mind.

180
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:07,180
Our mind has two states that are not good for meditation.

181
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,160
The first is called dullness.

182
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,400
The second one is called restlessness.

183
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,560
So our mind can be dull.

184
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,860
It's kind of like drowsiness.

185
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,720
It's kind of dark and unaware of things.

186
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,640
It's against our insight meditation.

187
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,640
Defeating the purpose.

188
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,640
So we need to adjust our mind.

189
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,320
And when we are restless, it's against our tranquility meditation.

190
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,780
So we won't be able to concentrate.

191
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:37,100
So we want to make sure our mind is clear, it's not sleepy, and it's very calm.

192
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:44,120
A great way of meditation is actually chanting the Buddha's name Amitabha in your mind during

193
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,740
your meditation.

194
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:51,640
That's actually a great object of meditation for you to focus and be able to concentrate.

195
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:57,960
All these objects, you can choose one depending on the state of how you are, there's no wrong

196
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,960
answer of meditation.

197
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,960
Okay, number five, we need to practice five virtues.

198
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,960
These are five skillful means, or we call it additive meditation.

199
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,220
First is called resolve.

200
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,720
We need to have goal.

201
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,680
We're very passionate about meditating.

202
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,260
I love to meditate.

203
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,580
I love to watch my breathing.

204
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,580
It's actually not boring.

205
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,580
It's actually my best friend.

206
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,580
It's actually my best friend.

207
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,580
It's very fun.

208
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,580
I love to chant the Buddha's name.

209
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,580
It's the best sound that's in my mind.

210
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,580
I love it.

211
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:34,580
So you want to develop a great liking and interest, then you will do well in it.

212
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,100
Number two, we need to have zeal, great diligence.

213
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:45,040
You want to keep doing it continuously, day after day, keep improving your diligence,

214
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,900
watching your five desires, driving away your hindrances, then you'll realize, oh, now I'm

215
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,900
able to deal with my anger.

216
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,900
I can catch my greediness.

217
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,900
You're able to deal with your emotion.

218
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,900
Then you have confidence.

219
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,900
Oh, I can do this.

220
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,900
I can be mindful of my thoughts.

221
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:09,900
Then you'll keep improving as you develop more skills, more concentration, and more

222
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,900
wisdom.

223
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,900
Okay, and number three is mindfulness.

224
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,900
Mindfulness itself is meditation.

225
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,900
Mindful of your desires, mindful of your hindrances.

226
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,900
Okay.

227
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,900
As long as you're mindful, we are already there.

228
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:29,900
When you're mindful, we are actually already letting it go, and we are on the way to enlightenment

229
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,900
and Buddhahood.

230
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,900
Number four is skillful insight.

231
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,900
We need to have wisdom.

232
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:40,900
That means we are able to choose what is gain, what is loss.

233
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:47,900
Do I want to keep going with the samsara life and keep having emotional rollercoaster and

234
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,900
keep going with this reincarnation?

235
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:56,900
Or I want to be able to transform, end my emotional suffering, and end the samsara?

236
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:02,900
So you need to have the skillful insight to know exactly what I should do this lifetime.

237
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,900
Number five is single-mindedness.

238
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,900
We want to be very determined about our practice.

239
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,900
Your mind is like a diamond.

240
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,900
Nobody can break you.

241
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,900
You are one-hearted, wanting to make this happen.

242
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:23,900
Lastly, we say train the mind to concentrate on one single-mindedness so that no endeavor

243
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,900
cannot be accomplished.

244
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:32,900
If you can concentrate on the single-mindedness, then there's nothing you cannot accomplish.

245
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,900
When Buddha was around, there was an 80-year-old man.

246
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,900
He was ordained as a monk when he was 80.

247
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:43,900
Everybody looked down on him, thinking there's no way he can accomplish anything.

248
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,900
But he worked very hard during the daytime.

249
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,900
He kept studying the Dharma.

250
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,900
At nighttime, he meditated.

251
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,900
After three years, he reached arhatship.

252
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,900
So if he can do it at 80, all of us can do it.

253
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,900
So believe in yourself.

254
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,900
Follow these 25 meditation preparations.

255
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,900
Then you're on the way to a successful spiritual journey.

256
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,900
So thank you for listening.

257
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,900
Amitabha.
