1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Today we are going to start on a series called Fourteen Chapters of Buddhism.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This is actually a book written by Professor Li Bingnan.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
He was a Dharma teacher of Master Jing Kong.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
He wrote this book in the 1960s to teach college students about Buddhism.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This book has three great qualities.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Number one, it's very complete. It encompasses all of Buddhism as a whole.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Number two, it's very accurate. It's only based on Buddha's actual sutras and teachings.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
There's not a word of personal opinion in this book.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Number three, it's very organized.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
All of the chapters are systematically ordered and it's made out of charts that are easy to follow and understand.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So today we are going to have an overview of the fourteen chapters.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Chapter One, Meaning of Buddha

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
When Shakyamuni Buddha first realized Buddhahood, he said,

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
How amazing! How amazing! All sentient beings have the Buddha nature and can be Buddhas.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's only because of polluted thinking and attachments

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
do they fail to realize this and to obtain certification.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So we all have the Buddha nature.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So the first chapter is to establish our goal.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Our goal of learning Buddhism is to reach Buddhahood.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Chapter Two, Eight Basis of Learning Buddhism

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
We need to analyze everything in eight aspects.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The first three, we need to analyze and know its substance, its form, and its function.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Then we need to know the cause, condition, and the effect.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And then we need to know the practice and the theory.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
If you can understand and analyze everything in terms of eight aspects,

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
then you'll be able to understand all the profound teachings in all the sutras.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Chapter Three is Clearing Up Misconceptions About Buddhism

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
We might have five kinds of misconceptions about Buddhism.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Number one, we might think Buddhism is superstitious.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
We just bow to statues for good luck.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So that's what some people might think.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Number two, we might think Buddhism is very pessimistic.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's all about death and reincarnation and suffering.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And number three, people might think it's creationism.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Buddha is a god that is creating everything.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Number four, we might think it's unrealistic.

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We cannot really practice the teaching in real life.

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's kind of too idealistic.

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Number five, we might think it's not very scientific.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
All the things that Buddha is talking about, we can't really prove it scientifically.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So if you have these doubts, then you won't be able to really learn Buddhism.

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So we need to clear up all the doubts.

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And if other people have doubts and questions, you'll be able to answer them.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So these first three chapters, they are the introduction to this book,

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
if we consider this book as a sutra.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Then chapter four through thirteen,

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
that's the main body of the sutra.

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Chapter fourteen is the transmission, the last chapter of the sutra.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Let's look at the main body of this book.

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Chapter four, life is difficult.

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
First, we need to understand what's our situation right now.

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Nobody can escape old age, sickness, and death,

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
or separation from loved ones, or lose of wealth, or natural disasters.

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So we need to understand our situation.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And use Buddhism to resolve our problems.

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
That's chapter four.

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Chapter five, the truth about past, present, and future.

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What if we tell you that reincarnation is true,

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
that you have prior lifetime, and you might not be a human.

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
This life is only a very short period of time in the whole reincarnation.

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And maybe you have many, many future lifetimes of reincarnation.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Maybe it's in the three lower realms.

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So we're going to talk about the twelve dependent originations.

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So you understand there's twelve links of cause and effect

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
that is causing the reincarnation.

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
From ignorance all the way to old age and death.

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So that's chapter five.

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Chapter four and five is about our life.

69
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Chapter six and seven is about the universe.

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Chapter six is about the six realms of reincarnation.

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
We can be in one of the six realms.

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
We can be in one of the six places when we are reincarnating.

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We might be a heavenly being.

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
We can be a human or a Shura realm,

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
which is between heavenly being and human.

76
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Or we can be in the three lower realms.

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Animal realm, or we can be a hungry ghost,

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
or we can be a hell being.

79
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You open up your eyes and realize reincarnation is true.

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So we're going to learn a lot of details about the six realms of reincarnation.

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Chapter seven is the world system.

82
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
We're going to talk about the physical place that we're in.

83
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
We call this world three thousand worlds.

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's made out of small world system,

85
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
medium size world system,

86
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
and large world system.

87
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Our earth is actually only a small dot in this big universe.

88
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So see the truth about our life and the universe.

89
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So chapter four through seven is about our current situation.

90
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Now we are sick in our reincarnation.

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So we need the teaching of Buddha,

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
which is chapter eight through thirteen,

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
to help us get out of our sickness and cure our disease.

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
That's the medicine of Buddha.

95
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
That is Buddha's teaching and Buddha's Dharma.

96
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Chapter eight is overview of the Dharma.

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
We need to understand what is Buddha's teaching.

98
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's basically the three aspects of learning.

99
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Morality, concentration, and wisdom.

100
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Morality is to refrain from doing all that is bad

101
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
and do all that is good.

102
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Concentration is for us not to be moved by the outer circumstances.

103
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Wisdom is for us to know the truth about our life and the universe.

104
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So we need to practice the three aspects of learning.

105
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That's the overview of the Dharma.

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Chapter nine, that's the five vehicles.

107
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Buddha gives us five general methods to practice Buddhism.

108
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And it's called vehicle because

109
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
it's like transportation, like a ferry boat,

110
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
transferring us from this shore of reincarnation

111
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
to the other shore of enlightenment and nirvana.

112
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
These five vehicles will be talked about in chapter ten, eleven, and twelve.

113
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So chapter ten is about the two worldly vehicles.

114
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
If you want to be a human again next lifetime,

115
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Buddha will teach you about the five precepts.

116
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
No killing, no stealing, no sexual misconduct,

117
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
no lying, and no intoxicants.

118
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
If you can practice the five precepts well this lifetime,

119
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
you might be able to become a human again next lifetime.

120
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And if you want to be a heavenly being,

121
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
then Buddha will teach you about the ten wholesome deeds,

122
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
which is expansion of the five precepts.

123
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So the human vehicle and the heavenly vehicle,

124
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
they are focused on not going to the three lower realms.

125
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
At least we don't want to be in the three lower realms.

126
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
That is the guarantee.

127
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
But if you want to get out of the six realms completely,

128
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
then Buddha will teach you about chapter eleven.

129
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
If you want to be an art hat,

130
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
it's called the shravaka vehicle.

131
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Buddha will teach you about the four noble truths.

132
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Suffering, cause of suffering, cessation of suffering,

133
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
and the path to end suffering.

134
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
If you really understand the four noble truths,

135
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
you can become an art hat and be out of the six realms of incarnation.

136
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Or if you want to be a payaka,

137
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
then you will learn the twelve dependent originations.

138
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You will understand the twelve links of interrelated cause and fact relationship

139
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
in order for you to understand the truth about how reincarnation works

140
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
and what is our reincarnation really about.

141
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So this is actually what we call the Theravada Buddhism.

142
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And if you want to be a bodhisattva,

143
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
then we will talk about chapter twelve.

144
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Buddha will teach you the six paramitas.

145
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
We should be giving and hold precepts,

146
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
and have endurance, diligence, concentration, and wisdom.

147
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So if you want to help all sentient beings,

148
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
your main focus is not on going to the Nirvana.

149
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You want to stay with the sentient beings and help them out.

150
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You will risk your life and have the danger of staying in this reincarnation

151
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
because you really are compassionate about saving and helping

152
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
all sentient beings.

153
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So everybody needs to actually learn all the five vehicles.

154
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You need to use them skillfully,

155
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
depending on your problem and your situation.

156
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
For example, if I'm having anger right now,

157
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I can use the worldly vehicles of ten wholesome deeds.

158
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I will say, okay, I should hold the precepts.

159
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I will have no anger.

160
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Or I can use the Four Noble Truths.

161
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Anger is a cause of suffering,

162
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
and there's actually not a me being offended,

163
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
so I should let go of my anger.

164
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So that's using the Four Noble Truths.

165
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Or you can use the six pyramidas.

166
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I am a bodhisattva.

167
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I should be tolerant to all people,

168
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
so I should let go of my anger.

169
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So use all the five dharmas, all the five vehicles,

170
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
skillfully and selectively.

171
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
But you need to learn all of them.

172
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And Chapter 13 is a special vehicle,

173
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
which is Pure Land Buddhism.

174
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
This is about chanting Amitabha Buddha's name.

175
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Why is it called a special vehicle?

176
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Because it's different from the five general vehicles.

177
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The five general vehicles is basically your own practice.

178
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's relying on your own strength

179
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
to practice morality, concentration, and wisdom.

180
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But if you chant Amitabha Buddha's name,

181
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
it's relying on Amitabha Buddha's power,

182
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
along with your own practice.

183
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So every time you chant Buddha's name,

184
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
it's like Buddha is giving us

185
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
all his merits to us freely.

186
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
We are now born in the royalty,

187
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
so our success in this life is guaranteed.

188
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So once you chant Buddha's name,

189
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
you are guaranteed to be out of the six dharma incarnations

190
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
and very quickly.

191
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So that's the special vehicle,

192
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
the expedient means.

193
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Lastly, in Chapter 14,

194
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
it's about vigilance.

195
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
We need to have really strong awareness.

196
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
We should really think about this lifetime.

197
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
We really want to go through reincarnation again.

198
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
What if there's really reincarnation?

199
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Buddha says the chance of us being a human again

200
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
next lifetime is extremely slim.

201
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Usually, we are in the three lower rounds.

202
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And if you really know that practicing the dharma

203
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
will make you go out of the sixth round,

204
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
wouldn't you practice really hard?

205
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And if you know that you can become a Buddha,

206
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
wouldn't you spend all your time chanting Buddha's name,

207
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
learning the dharma,

208
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
so have vigilance and feel the urgency to practice.

209
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Right now, we don't feel any urgency

210
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
because we don't see reincarnation.

211
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
We feel like this is the only life,

212
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
is this existence, but it's not.

213
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You know, we have many, many, many lifetimes to come.

214
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
We need to work on our cultivation

215
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
of the few years that we have left as a human being.

216
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
We should really practice

217
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
and don't waste our life away.

218
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Okay, so this is the overview of the 14 chapters.

219
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And next time, we are going to start on chapter one,

220
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
the meaning of Buddha.

221
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So thank you for listening. Amitābha.
