1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,720
Today we will talk about Love All Equally.

2
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,720
Buddha's mind is a mind of great compassion.

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,080
We will use verses of Confucius' teaching to learn about love all equally.

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,440
Hopefully it will bring out our great compassion.

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,680
Let's first talk about our body.

6
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,440
How do we treat others with great compassion?

7
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,440
1.

8
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,800
Don't flatter the rich or despise the poor.

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,640
Great compassion is unconditional love, without any discrimination based on people's wealth

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,640
or status.

11
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:51,060
Shakyamuni Buddha was a prince, but he left the kingdom to search for the truth.

12
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:55,400
When he finally reached Buddhahood, he went back to his country to teach.

13
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,060
His father, the king, wanted to help Buddha.

14
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:02,060
So he asked all the elites of the Shakyamuni to become Buddha's disciples.

15
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,520
At the same time, there was a barber named Upali.

16
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,860
He really wanted to become Buddha's disciple as well.

17
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,000
So he asked the elites to join him.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,460
But the elites looked down on him and told him, there is no way that a sutra, which is

19
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:19,740
the lowest social class in India, can become Buddha's disciple.

20
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,560
But Upali did not give up.

21
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,060
He actually rushed to see Buddha, and of course Buddha accepted him as a disciple.

22
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,060
When the elites arrived, Buddha accepted him as a disciple.

23
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,060
When the elites arrived, Buddha accepted him as a disciple.

24
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,060
He also asked them to bow down to Upali.

25
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,060
And simply asked them to bow down to Upali.

26
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,140
The elites were furious when they saw Upali and refused to bow down to him.

27
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:41,420
So Buddha said to them, a man is noble based on his behavior, not on his social class.

28
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,820
You guys are actually of a lower class because you are now slaves of your arrogance.

29
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,660
The elites finally bowed down to Upali.

30
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,740
Buddha is a great teacher that taught us true equality.

31
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,160
Number two, Always Give More and Take Less!

32
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,160
This is a very ancient doctrine.

33
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:02,480
A Bodhisattva is always giving because they want other people to be happy.

34
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,440
So by giving, they will make others happy and benefit others.

35
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:11,640
A Bodhisattva is always aware of any greediness that arises in them.

36
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,560
So they use giving to eradicate any of their greediness.

37
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,040
In ancient China, there was a little boy.

38
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,280
His parents passed away when he was young.

39
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,040
So he was raised by his uncle and he lived with his uncle's seven sons.

40
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,720
When he reached adulthood,

41
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,200
uncle wanted to divide up the family inheritance into two shares.

42
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,160
One for him and one for his seven sons.

43
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,480
But this boy told uncle,

44
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,560
I will just only take one eighth of the family inheritance

45
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,400
because I'm the same class as your sons.

46
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,600
Uncle says, no, you represent your dad, so you deserve half.

47
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,800
This boy insists, so the uncle divided up the family share into eight shares.

48
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,000
All seven sons, they were very happy.

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,960
This boy later became a prominent government official because of his virtues.

50
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,000
Always give more and take less.

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,920
Number three, treat subordinates with kindness and generosity.

52
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,280
In the Bodhisattva precept, it says,

53
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,720
all men are my fathers and all women are my mothers.

54
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,200
We should treat the subordinates as our own parents.

55
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,080
Do not just use them for labors.

56
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,320
There's a family that had a nanny for over 20 years.

57
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,800
They really appreciate the nanny.

58
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,680
The nanny service over the years, when she's about to retire,

59
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,200
they give him a house and a large retirement package.

60
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,040
So we always want to treat subordinates with kindness and generosity.

61
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,840
Now let's talk about it in terms of our speech.

62
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,040
How do we speak to others with great compassion?

63
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,800
Number one, don't expose others' shortcomings or secrets.

64
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,560
In Chinese, we have a saying,

65
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,960
conceal wrongdoing and disclose goodness.

66
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,680
That includes our parents,

67
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,080
or our siblings,

68
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,800
or anyone that we know.

69
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,160
We do not want to disclose their shortcomings.

70
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,680
Also, this is a Bodhisattva precept,

71
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,720
not to disclose any shortcomings of the monks,

72
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,720
or nuns, or laymen, or laywomen.

73
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,040
Make sure that we don't break any precepts.

74
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,000
Do not talk about the wrongdoing of another temple,

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,360
and do not talk about the wrongdoings of other Bodhisattva.

76
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,320
These are all large offenses.

77
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,360
Number two, praising the goodness of others is a virtue,

78
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,080
especially when people really need it.

79
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,480
When people are really sick or they're emotionally very down,

80
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,800
if you give them some kind words and say,

81
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,200
you're such a great mother,

82
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,280
we really appreciate all your love and generosity,

83
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,720
and we really love you.

84
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,400
When you give people kindness,

85
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,160
they will have the cheerful heart,

86
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,480
their sickness will recover faster.

87
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,480
Even if they pass away because of their positive wholesome thoughts,

88
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,880
they will be reborn in a good state of mind.

89
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,040
Number three,

90
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,160
if you give them some kind words and say,

91
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,560
you're such a great mother,

92
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,120
you really appreciate all your love and generosity,

93
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,760
they will be reborn in a good state of mind.

94
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,160
So always give sincere praises.

95
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,160
Number three,

96
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,640
encourage virtues and give sound advices

97
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,640
when people are having mistakes.

98
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,240
We do not expose people's shortcomings,

99
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,240
but we have the duty to help them transform and change.

100
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,840
There was two brothers.

101
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,280
The older brother was a government official.

102
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,480
He started taking briberies.

103
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,000
So he thought of a way.

104
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
He actually went to be a servant

105
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,560
and worked as a servant for a whole year.

106
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,680
After the year,

107
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,160
all the money that he made,

108
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,040
he brought it to the older brother and said,

109
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,000
dear brother,

110
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,320
we should make money honestly with our own labor

111
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,920
and not to take any money that's not supposed to be ours.

112
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,600
The older brother felt ashamed of himself

113
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,320
and actually transformed.

114
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,520
With sincerity,

115
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,840
great compassion and wisdom,

116
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,400
we can convince others

117
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,760
to transform.

118
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,400
Now let's talk about in terms of our mind.

119
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,160
What is our attitude of compassion?

120
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,200
Number one,

121
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,800
don't impose on others what you do not desire.

122
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,840
This is actually one of the biggest teaching of Confucius.

123
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,040
Confucius says there's one word that you can practice all your life

124
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,360
and that word is tolerance.

125
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,400
Always be tolerant of others.

126
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,280
Put yourself in other people's shoes and see how they feel.

127
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,280
For example,

128
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,800
your parents-in-law should treat the daughter-in-law and son-in-law

129
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,240
as their own children

130
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,360
and not treat them like outsiders.

131
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,360
The daughter-in-law and the son-in-law

132
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,080
should treat the parents-in-law as their own mom and dad.

133
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,400
Respect and love them as if they're own parents.

134
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,040
This is all reciprocal.

135
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,400
Relationship is based on our heart,

136
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,480
view for other people's position.

137
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,360
That is true compassion.

138
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,400
Number two, repay kindness and let go of resentment.

139
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,320
Feeling of gratitude,

140
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,680
gratitude is the key to happiness.

141
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,440
Always be grateful for everybody.

142
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,880
We study hard because we want to pay back our parents' kindness

143
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,560
and we study the Dharma

144
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,240
because we want to pay back Buddha's great kindness to us.

145
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,640
Always feel gratitude and appreciation.

146
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,640
You will live a life on purpose and you'll feel very fulfilled.

147
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,880
Also, we want to let go of resentments.

148
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,280
Do not hold any grudges toward anyone.

149
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,280
Always forget about the wrongdoings.

150
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,400
Be grateful for all the people that love us

151
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,400
and we also want to be grateful for the people that abused us,

152
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
backstabbed us and hurt us

153
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,400
because they made us stronger,

154
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,400
have more wisdom,

155
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,400
have more compassion.

156
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
So be grateful.

157
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,400
Turn good karmic relationships and bad karmic relationships

158
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
into Dharma relationships,

159
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,400
which means we're all growing spiritually.

160
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,400
That's all we're trying to do in this lifetime.

161
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,400
That way, every relationship is going to be a good one.

162
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,400
That's all we're trying to do in this lifetime.

163
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,400
Every relationship is a good relationship.

164
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,400
Everything that happened to you is a good thing.

165
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
So you will be a bodhisattva

166
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,400
and you will practice very carefully and happily.

167
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,400
So treat our loved ones and our enemies equally.

168
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,400
That is true compassion.

169
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,400
In the Diamond Sutra, it basically teaches us

170
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,400
to detach from all appearance and cultivate all goodness.

171
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,400
So we want to detach from all the appearance of

172
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,400
this is my enemy, this is my loved one.

173
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,400
That way, we can really practice all goodness.

174
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,400
Number three, use reasoning, not power, to influence others.

175
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,400
Do not use authority to impose on others.

176
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,400
We always want to use sound reasoning,

177
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,400
such as cause and effect.

178
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,400
We don't want to say,

179
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,400
I'm the mother, I'm the father,

180
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,400
you must listen to me.

181
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,400
If you just use your authority,

182
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,400
even if they listen and obey,

183
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,400
their hearts will not be with you.

184
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,400
There was a little girl, Natalie,

185
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,400
and her younger brother.

186
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,400
One day, the girl was very upset at the younger brother,

187
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,400
so she complained to her father.

188
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,400
Dad, Nathan broke my toy, ate my ice cream,

189
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,400
and drew all over my homework.

190
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,400
The father calmly talked to Natalie,

191
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,400
What about you? Did you do anything wrong today?

192
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,400
Natalie thought about it and said,

193
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,400
Yes, I forgot to fold my blankets this morning.

194
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,400
I lost my homework and I didn't do the dishes.

195
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,400
So the father said,

196
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,400
So you made mistakes too.

197
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,400
We need to forgive ourselves and forgive all others.

198
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,400
Like Bob, one of the little girl's head,

199
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,400
she happily forgave her younger brother.

200
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,400
So the father used sound reasoning to teach his children

201
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,400
and not use his authority.

202
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,400
That is the only way to influence and teach others.

203
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:44,400
These are simple ways for us to bring out our great compassion.

204
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,400
Just like the Zen master said,

205
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,400
A three-year-old can understand,

206
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,400
but an 80-year-old still can't.

207
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,400
We still struggle to do it.

208
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,400
So we just need to be aware,

209
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,400
practice daily,

210
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,400
and do not give up.

211
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,400
If we conduct ourselves with these standards,

212
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,400
we are already walking the Bodhisattva way.

213
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,400
So thank you for listening.

214
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,400
Amitabha.
