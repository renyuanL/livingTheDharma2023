00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,720
Today we are going to talk about the Four Mindfulness.

2
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:23,560
Buddha teaches us to be mindful of our body, feelings, mind and Dharma.

3
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:29,280
Before we go into the mindfulness, let's first talk about the Four Noble Truths,

4
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,680
Buddha's basic Dharma wheel.

5
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,800
First, we should know that we are going through suffering right now

6
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,160
because we are still in samsara, we are still reincarnating.

7
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,840
So that is the result of our life right now.

8
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,040
We have our causes of suffering.

9
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,160
What is causing our reincarnation is not other people,

10
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:57,000
it's our own afflictions, our greed, anger and ignorance that's causing the samsara.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,600
We learn Buddhism so we can reach the cessation of suffering.

12
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,240
There should be no more reincarnation and we can reach Nirvana.

13
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,240
Number four, the path to end suffering.

14
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,080
So the Four Mindfulness is the path to end suffering.

15
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:22,120
We are suffering because we have these four upside down views about these four fundamentals.

16
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,560
First, we think our body is pure.

17
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,800
That's why we love our body, we take care of it, we want it to be beautiful and healthy.

18
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:36,800
But Buddha teaches us to be mindful that our body is impure.

19
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:46,800
Everything that comes out of our body is dirty, including our mucus, our saliva, our urine, our feces.

20
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,160
Nothing that comes out of our body is pure.

21
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,240
If we know it's impure, we won't be so attached to it.

22
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,360
And we can let go.

23
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,960
We should let go our attachment to the body.

24
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,920
Our second view is we think our feelings is all happiness.

25
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,280
Everything that we're pursuing in the world, we think will make us happy.

26
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,820
But know that all happiness is condition arising.

27
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:17,300
When it ends, it's no longer happiness, it becomes suffering.

28
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,200
So the reality is that all feelings are suffering.

29
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,600
We should let go of our upside down view.

30
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,000
That the feeling is blissfulness.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,760
Number three, we are attached to our mind.

32
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,960
We think our mind is permanent.

33
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,720
The thing that's on our mind right now, we think it's such a big deal.

34
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,800
It's worrying us and we're feeling this anxiety.

35
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,280
Everything is so real, but our mind is truly impermanent.

36
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,500
Number four, the object of our mind, we call it the Dharma, all worldly things.

37
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,960
We think there is a selfhood.

38
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:59,320
We think there is a me, there's an ego that is controlling everything.

39
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:06,380
These four are the upside down views about our body, feelings, mind, and Dharma.

40
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:13,800
That's why Buddha teaches us to have four mindfulness to end the suffering by contemplating

41
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,200
on the reality, which are the opposite from the upside down view.

42
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,400
During meditation and during everyday life, see clearly.

43
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:31,500
The reality, everything is impure, suffering, impermanent, and non-self.

44
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,000
Then we will reach enlightenment and we will cease all sufferings.

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,840
This is the basic for mindfulness according to the Four Noble Truths.

46
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:51,400
According to the Tiantai Buddhism of Master Zhi Yi, he categorized all Shakyamuni Buddha's

47
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,760
teaching into four.

48
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,300
These four doctrines of conversion.

49
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:04,760
Number one is the Tripitaka teaching, that's the Theravada Buddhism, which focuses on getting

50
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:13,480
out of the suffering by practicing this basic for mindfulness from samsara to nirvana.

51
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:20,400
They focus all their attention on getting rid of their defilements and their four upside

52
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,400
down views.

53
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,400
This is called the right view.

54
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:22,440
This is called the right view.

55
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,980
They are rising and seizing four noble truths.

56
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,940
Samsara and nirvana are very real.

57
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:37,660
In this case, it's really rising and really seizing to the Theravada Buddhist.

58
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,920
However, number two, common teaching.

59
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:48,120
This common means common to the Theravada Buddhism and common to the Mahayana Buddhism.

60
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,400
There is actually a common teaching which is Prajna.

61
00:04:52,400 --> 00:05:03,200
of emptiness emptiness is the reality because samsara and nirvana are actually the same they

62
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:13,520
are both empty in nature there is no self nature to samsara or nirvana both are like in the dream

63
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:21,280
one is a nightmare one is a good dream that's all when you practice the four mindfulness stand in

64
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:29,360
the point of view of the emptiness of all things it becomes easier it's like your ego you see the

65
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:36,560
big picture and when you practice in this world it's much easier to get rid of your defilement

66
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:46,880
so it's called the non-arising for noble truth there is no real samsara real nirvana everything

67
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,120
is emptiness we should see the truth and nothing really

68
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:58,320
arises nothing really ceases it's all conditioned and that is all number three

69
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:05,120
is distinctive teaching this is especially tailored toward bodhisattvas they practice

70
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:12,560
to save and deliver all sentient beings they have the strong bodhi resolve to help all sentient

71
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:21,120
beings out of reincarnation so the four noble truth is called immeasurable four noble truths

72
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:28,480
all sentient beings in the ten dharma rounds everyone has their suffering they have their

73
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:37,040
different body mind and dharma so we respect everybody's differences and we use the suffering

74
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:44,960
of this lifetime to transform ourselves into a bodhisattva and to benefit all sentient beings

75
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:51,120
if our body is sick we do not dwell on it we think oh because of my sickness

76
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:59,520
i really feel the pain of all sentient beings i wish all sentient beings will be free from sickness

77
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:06,880
so we're using this impurity of the body to become a bodhisattva when we are experiencing

78
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:13,280
different kind of sufferings and obstacles we use the suffering and change our mind

79
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:20,320
our mind can create a different world if we just appreciate and be thankful we can change the

80
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:29,200
world we can use this challenge to develop our leadership skill to change the situation for the

81
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:36,880
better so a bodhisattva is always using the sufferings of this lifetime to develop even

82
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:44,720
further to practice their six pyramidas they also know the impermanence of their mind because the

83
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:51,040
mind is impermanent we can change it so we think like a buddha we do everything like a buddha because

84
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:57,040
it's impermanent that means we can change our thinking from our mundane person that is always

85
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:04,800
stressed or having a lot of craving into a real bodhisattva that is always having the heart of

86
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:12,960
the dharma a bodhisattva will see that everything in the world there is not a self instead they

87
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:20,960
think everybody all the dharma around is me we are actually one in this world together

88
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:29,840
there is nothing better than feeling the oneness of the entire universe bodhisattva they have

89
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:38,160
immeasurable heart they love all sentient beings and they use this body feeling mind and dharma

90
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:46,640
to cultivate into a real bodhisattva number four is the complete teaching this is the

91
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,040
second enlightenment teaching complete means we are all complete

92
00:08:51,280 --> 00:09:00,480
the mind is the buddha we should have faith that we are exactly the same as all achieve buddha even

93
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:07,280
though we have a lot of upside down views right now but these can all be changed in one instant

94
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:15,440
when we awaken to know illusion is to depart from it to depart from illusion is to be enlightened

95
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,040
just one instant that we awaken to our true nature we are really the buddha

96
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:30,080
there is no suffering to end because samsara is the same as nirvana in our buddha nature and

97
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:38,320
there is no affliction to eradicate because all afflictions are in nature the same as bodhi so

98
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:45,600
when you have this type of wisdom understanding that you are truly the mind of the buddha you have

99
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,960
infinite potential every time you to be enlightened that is the ultimate enlightenment

100
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:58,780
breath even though it's impure is the buddha that is breathing even though there is suffering

101
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:08,000
but suffering is nirvana even though my mind is impermanent it has an eternal nature that never

102
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,700
changes or moves when we get rid of our ego that's our true nature the buddha that's full of

103
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:23,480
infinite wisdom and infinite compassion when a person really knows his true nature there's

104
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:30,300
nothing that is of any obstruction there is no more resistance in his or her life

105
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:38,920
so that is the complete teaching which is called the non-doing for noble truth not doing because

106
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:45,380
you are already the buddha you don't need to cultivate the four mindfulness so hard

107
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:45,660
because you are already the buddha and you don't need to cultivate the four mindfulness so hard

108
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:45,680
because you are already the buddha you don't need to cultivate the four mindfulness so hard

109
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,180
because you already know they are the same.

110
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,900
All you have to do is wake up

111
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,940
and know that you have the true nature.

112
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,760
Lastly, I would like to share a story.

113
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,840
There is a village of 500 monkeys.

114
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:04,840
499 monkeys all have only one eye.

115
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,580
Only one monkey has two eyes.

116
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,300
Everybody think he is a weirdo

117
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,780
and despise him, make fun of him.

118
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:18,340
So he grew up very depressed and have low self-esteem.

119
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,880
But one day he decided to leave the village.

120
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,440
Once he left the village, he went into the forest.

121
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,760
Much to his surprise, he saw other monkeys.

122
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,300
All the other monkeys have two eyes.

123
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,740
Then he said, so I'm not the weird one.

124
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,560
I'm actually normal.

125
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,000
After he realized that, he became so happy

126
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,180
and he lived happily ever after.

127
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,520
We all have two eyes.

128
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,260
That means we all have the Buddha nature.

129
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,060
Our mind is the Buddha.

130
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,940
There is actually no upside down view.

131
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:00,660
There's no samsara that is hurting us right now.

132
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,940
All we have to do is to wake up

133
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,800
and know our true nature.

134
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,940
Then we live happily ever after.

135
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:11,940
That is the complete and perfect teaching.

136
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,940
Buddha wants us to live happily ever after.

137
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,360
Buddha wants us to reach this level of wisdom.

138
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:19,400
Whatever you practice, you will succeed in your practice.

139
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:24,340
So even with this complete teaching,

140
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:28,780
you are still doing the fundamental for mindfulness.

141
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,900
It's not that you don't have to cultivate anymore.

142
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,700
It's just that you start at the highest point.

143
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,140
Your starting point is you are the Buddha.

144
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:42,280
So that is the fastest and the quickest way to reach enlightenment.

145
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:42,700
So that's the point.

146
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,280
So that's the class for today.

147
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,480
Thank you for listening.

148
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,480
Amitabha.
